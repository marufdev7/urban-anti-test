"""
Project-wide pytest fixtures.

⚠️ **Created in T1.8 for one reason: throttle state is not rolled back.** `pytest-django` wraps
each test in a database transaction, so DB rows vanish between tests — but rate-limit counters live
in the Redis `default` cache, which nothing resets. Without `_reset_throttle_cache` below, buckets
accumulate across the whole session: unrelated tests written before T1.8 exhaust the per-IP window
partway through the run and fail with a spurious `429`, and *which* ones fail depends on test order.

This is autouse and session-wide on purpose. Making each new test remember to clear the cache is
the kind of rule that holds until someone adds a throttled endpoint and does not know it exists.

# so without this, one test file silently replaces `socket`, `ssl`, `select` and `threading` for
# the remaining ~1300 tests, with Django and psycopg already loaded against the originals. The
# failure mode is order-dependent hangs, which is the worst kind to debug.
#
# Nothing the harness relies on is weakened: the load profile runs in the `loadgen` container,
# where this variable is unset and gevent patches normally. The tests only exercise the profile's
# gate and pool logic, which is plain Python.

    """Swap object storage for `InMemoryStorage` for the whole run (T2.4).

    ⚠️ **Added in T2.4 for the same class of reason as `_reset_throttle_cache`: the default
    storage is not part of the test transaction.** `STORAGES["default"]` is `S3Boto3Storage`, so
    the moment a `Media` fixture existed, saving one opened a real connection to the MinIO
    container — and with no `STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY` in the test environment botocore fell through to
    an EC2 instance-metadata lookup and failed with `NoCredentialsError` after a timeout.

    ⚠️ **A real `Storage`, not a mock.** `InMemoryStorage` implements `save`, `open`, `exists`,
    `delete` and `url`, so `upload_media()`'s `media.file.save(...)` and the serializer's
    `stored.url` run their genuine code paths — only the network is gone. A patched-out storage
    would let a regression that never writes the sanitized bytes pass unnoticed.

    ⚠️ **Overridden here rather than in `settings/dev.py`.** `dev.py` is what the local dev server
    runs on, where uploads are meant to reach MinIO; flipping it there would make the running
    application silently lose every photo on restart.

    ⚠️ `staticfiles` is respecified because `override_settings` replaces `STORAGES` wholesale
    rather than merging into it — omitting the key leaves `staticfiles_storage` unresolvable.

    (`SESSION_CACHE_ALIAS`). That is safe because sessions use `cached_db` — the DB row is the
