# UrbanMend — Backend REST API Specification

> The production-ready HTTP contract for the UrbanMend backend, derived entirely from the approved PRD, Architecture, and Domain Model.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Document** | `docs/04-api-specification.md` |
| **Version** | 1.2 (provenance only — ADR-001 recorded; no contract changes) |
| **Status** | Planning phase — pending stakeholder sign-off |
| **Author role** | Principal Backend Architect |
| **Date** | 2026-08-03 |
| **Source of truth** | `01-prd.md` (v1.3) · `02-architecture.md` (v1.2) · `03-data-model.md` (v1.2) · `07-adr-001-app-framework.md` — all approved |
| **Scope** | Backend REST API only. Client/UI is a consumer. |

### Ground rules
- The three approved docs are the **single source of truth.** This spec introduces **no new business rules or features.** Every endpoint traces to a `FR-x`/`NFR-x` or a Domain rule (`BR-x`).
- Where behavior depends on an **unresolved open question**, the endpoint **references it** (PRD `❓Qx`, Domain `DM-Qx`, `ASSUMP-x`) and does **not** invent an answer.
- **No implementation code.** Schemas are described as JSON contracts, not database or language artifacts.

### Interactive documentation

The running service publishes generated OpenAPI 3 documentation at `/api/schema/` (machine-readable
schema) and `/api/docs/` (interactive Swagger UI). Both endpoints are public; API operations retain
their normal session-cookie and CSRF requirements.

### Changelog
- **v1.2 (2026-08-03)** — **No contract changes: no endpoint, payload, status code, or header was altered.** The framework was committed to Python + Django + DRF (`docs/07-adr-001-app-framework.md`, ADR-001); two informational notes were added (§2 on CSRF, §1.2 on GeoJSON) recording which library supplies a mechanism this spec already required. **This spec remains the authority over the implementation, not the reverse** — where DRF's defaults differ from the contracts below (notably the §4.1 error envelope and the §1.2 cursor pagination shape), the implementation is customised to match this document (Project Plan T0.6).
- **v1.1 (2026-07-22)** — Q2/Q4/Q7/Q8/Q9/DM-Q5/Q7/Q8 resolved.

## 1. API Design Principles & Conventions

### 1.1 Principles
- **Resource-oriented REST over HTTPS.** Nouns as resources, HTTP verbs as actions, appropriate status codes.
- **Issue-centric, not Report-centric.** Triage, severity, status, assignment, comments, and confirmations hang off `/issues`; `/reports` covers intake and a citizen tracking their own submission (Domain: Report vs Issue separation).
- **Server is authoritative.** Derived data (corroboration count, proximity context, classification result, severity rationale) is **read-only** to all clients (C-10, BR-22/24). No client can set severity except an Authority override (FR-20).
- **Predictable & consistent.** One error envelope, one pagination style, one date format, uniform naming.
- **Secure by default.** Authorization enforced server-side on every mutating and sensitive-read action (FR-3, BR-27); least privilege per the §4.2 role matrix.
- **Extensible.** Additive evolution (new fields, new filters) never breaks clients; versioning guards breaking changes.

### 1.2 Conventions
| Aspect | Convention |
|--------|-----------|
| Base URL | `https://{host}/api/v1` |
| Format | JSON only (`Content-Type: application/json`); `charset=utf-8` (Bangla/English, NFR-8) |
| Resource naming | Plural, kebab-free lowercase nouns: `/reports`, `/issues`, `/notification-preferences` |
| Identifiers | Opaque server-generated string IDs (UUID-style); never sequential/guessable in URLs |
| Timestamps | ISO-8601 UTC (`2026-07-22T10:15:30Z`); clients localize (NFR-8) |
| Coordinates | GeoJSON conventions: `{ "lng": ..., "lat": ... }`; map payloads as GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` |
| Field casing | `camelCase` in JSON bodies |
| Nulls | Omit unknown/derived-not-yet-ready fields or return explicit `null`; documented per field |
| Idempotency | Unsafe creates that must not duplicate accept an `Idempotency-Key` header (BR-5) |
| Partial update | `PATCH` for partial mutations; `PUT` reserved for full replacement (rarely used here) |
| Localization | `Accept-Language: bn` \| `en` influences human-readable strings where the server localizes |

### 1.3 Standard collection envelope
All list endpoints return:
```json
{
  "data": [ /* resource objects */ ],
  "page": { "nextCursor": "opaque-or-null", "prevCursor": "opaque-or-null", "limit": 20 },
  "meta": { "count": 20 }
}
```
Single-resource endpoints return the bare resource object (no envelope).

> *Implementation note (ADR-001, informational — no contract change):* three conventions above are **not** DRF defaults and must be built to match this spec, not inherited (Project Plan T0.6):
> - the `data`/`page`/`meta` envelope and opaque cursors require a custom pagination class — DRF's built-in cursor pagination emits a different shape;
> - `camelCase` bodies require an explicit renaming layer — DRF serializers emit `snake_case` field names by default, and this is the single easiest way for the implementation to silently drift from the contract;
> - map payloads as GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` are supplied by `djangorestframework-gis` (`GeoFeatureModelSerializer`), which satisfies the coordinate convention above.
>
> These are named so the gap is visible during implementation. The conventions themselves are unchanged.

## 2. Authentication Strategy

**Approved mechanism (Architecture §8): server-validated sessions**, chosen over stateless JWT for reliable **immediate revocation** (moderation, deprovisioning). No cross-service token sharing is needed at this scale.

- On successful login the server issues an **opaque session token** in a **`Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite` cookie**. The token is not readable by JavaScript.
- **CSRF protection:** because auth rides in a cookie, state-changing requests require a CSRF token (double-submit cookie or header token). Safe methods (`GET`/`HEAD`) are exempt.
- **Session revocation** is immediate server-side (logout, suspension, deprovisioning) — supports BR-25/BR-33 and moderation.
- **Verification** (FR-1): phone via OTP, email via link/code. Unverified accounts cannot receive notifications on an unverified channel (BR-30) and have limited capability.
- **Authority/Admin** may be required to use **2FA** (FR-4, optional per policy).
- **Anonymous access** to write endpoints: **Q4 RESOLVED — login required.** All submissions require a Citizen session. Anonymous write access is not supported.
- **Public reads**: **Q7 RESOLVED — map and issue list are publicly visible** to unauthenticated users.

> *Note:* mechanics of OTP/token storage are implementation (Architecture §8) and out of scope here; this spec defines only the request/response contract.

> *Implementation note (ADR-001, informational — no contract change):* the mechanism specified above is supplied directly by Django's session framework on the `cached_db` backend, with DRF's `SessionAuthentication` enforcing the CSRF requirement in this section on unsafe methods; 2FA (FR-4) comes from `django-otp`. Named here only so the contract has a visible implementation path — **the contract above governs**, and any divergence in cookie flags, exemptions, or the CSRF header name is a defect in the implementation, not an amendment to this section.

### 2.1 Authorization model
Every protected endpoint states required **role** (Citizen / Authority / Admin) and any **conditions** (own-resource, authority category-scope BR-26, pre-triage editability, mandatory reason). Authorization is enforced in the service layer (FR-3).

## 4. Cross-Cutting Contracts

### 4.1 Error response model
Uniform envelope for all errors:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
    "message": "Human-readable summary (localized where applicable).",
    "details": [
      { "field": "location", "issue": "REQUIRED", "message": "A location is required." }
    ],
    "traceId": "correlation-id-for-support"
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Standard status codes
| Code | Meaning / usage |
|------|-----------------|
| 200 OK | Successful read/update |
| 201 Created | Resource created (returns resource + `Location` header) |
| 202 Accepted | Accepted for **async** processing (e.g. report submitted, triage pending — NFR-3) |
| 204 No Content | Successful with no body (e.g. delete, mark-read) |
| 400 Bad Request | Malformed syntax / unparseable body |
| 401 Unauthorized | Missing/invalid session |
| 403 Forbidden | Authenticated but not permitted (role/scope) |
| 404 Not Found | Resource absent, or hidden from this caller |
| 409 Conflict | State conflict (invalid status transition BR-16, duplicate confirmation BR-23, idempotency-key **reuse or in-flight** — see §4.6; a *replay* returns the original success, not `409`) |
| 410 Gone | Resource removed by moderation (FR-31) |
| 413 Payload Too Large | Image exceeds limit (FR-7) |
| 415 Unsupported Media Type | Disallowed file type (FR-7) |
| 422 Unprocessable Entity | Semantically invalid (business-rule violation) |
| 429 Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded (NFR-13, FR-33) |
| 500 / 503 | Server error / dependency unavailable (LLM/geocoder degraded — degrades, not blocks, per NFR-4) |

### 4.3 Common error codes (referenced per endpoint as "standard errors")
`UNAUTHENTICATED (401)` · `FORBIDDEN (403)` · `NOT_FOUND (404)` · `VALIDATION_FAILED (400/422)` · `RATE_LIMITED (429)` · `CONFLICT (409)` · `INTERNAL (500)`.

### 4.4 Pagination, filtering, sorting, search
- **Pagination — cursor-based (default).** `?limit=` (default 20, max 100) + `?cursor=`. Cursor pagination is chosen because the authority queue is sorted and mutated concurrently; offset pagination would skip/repeat rows. Response carries `page.nextCursor`/`prevCursor`. Pagination is **mandatory** on all collections (NFR-2).
- **Filtering** — explicit query params per resource (e.g. `?category=roads&severity=high&status=in_progress`). Multiple values comma-separated (`?severity=high,medium`). Unknown params → `400`.
- **Sorting** — `?sort=` with a documented allowlist per resource (e.g. issues: `severity`, `age`, `-createdAt`). Default per resource stated below. Leading `-` = descending.
- **Search** — `?q=` free-text over documented fields (e.g. report description); bilingual (NFR-8). Spatial search uses explicit geo params (`?nearLng=&nearLat=&radiusM=` or `?bbox=`), not `q`.
- **Field selection (optional, extensibility)** — `?fields=` allowlist to trim payloads; additive, never required.

### 4.5 Rate limiting (NFR-13, FR-33, FR-4)
- Applied per-identity (session) and per-IP for anonymous/auth endpoints.
- Tighter buckets on: login/OTP (brute-force, FR-4), report submission (spam, FR-33), and anything that can trigger LLM calls (cost, NFR-13/RISK-3).
- Response headers on every limited endpoint: `RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Remaining`, `RateLimit-Reset`; `429` includes `Retry-After`.
- Exceeding LLM cost/rate caps does **not** fail submission — triage degrades to the keyword fallback (FR-13a); the API still returns `202`.

**Which endpoints are limited** (amended 2026-08-11, T2.9 — the doc named "report submission" without saying whether the photo route was included):

| Endpoint | Buckets |
|---|---|
| `POST /auth/login`, `/auth/verify`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/2fa/*` | per-IP, per-identifier, per-session as applicable (FR-4) |
| `POST /reports` | per-account **and** per-IP |
| `POST /media` | per-account **and** per-IP |
| everything else | unlimited beyond the platform default |

- ⚠️ **`POST /media` is limited, and `GET /reports`, `GET /reports/{id}`, `GET /media/{id}` are not.** FR-33 is about submission. An upload is the most expensive request a citizen can make (decode, re-encode, storage write, worker job); a read is one indexed query, and limiting it would degrade the map and the authority queue for a legitimately busy operator.
- ⚠️ **The per-IP bucket is shared between `POST /reports` and `POST /media`.** A five-photo report spends six units of it. This is the Sybil control (PRD §T3): a per-account bucket resets with every new registration, but the source address does not. A client may therefore see `429` on `POST /reports` as a consequence of its own uploads — `RateLimit-Remaining` reflects whichever bucket has least headroom, so it is the value to respect.
- ⚠️ **A request that the endpoint then rejects still consumes its bucket**, including `422 OUT_OF_CITY`, `400 VALIDATION_FAILED` and `413`/`415` on upload. Serving invalid content is not cheaper than serving valid content, and exempting failures would make the limit apply only to legitimate use.
- ⚠️ **An idempotent replay (§4.6) also consumes its bucket**, even though it creates nothing. A retry burst is far below these limits; clients that poll a key aggressively should read `RateLimit-Remaining` rather than assume replays are free.
- **The numeric limits and windows are deployment configuration, not contract** — the same status §4.6 gives the idempotency retention window. Clients must read the `RateLimit-*` headers rather than hard-code a rate, and must treat `429` as retryable after `Retry-After`.


### 4.6 Idempotency
`POST /reports` (and other duplicate-sensitive creates) accept `Idempotency-Key`. Keys are scoped **per user and per operation**, and retained for a bounded window.

**The header is optional.** A request without it is processed normally and carries **no** de-duplication guarantee — BR-5 is satisfied by clients that send a key and retry with the same one. A blank value is treated as absent. A key longer than the documented bound is rejected `400 VALIDATION_FAILED`.

Three outcomes, and they are distinct on purpose:

| Situation | Result |
|---|---|
| First use of the key | Request is processed normally. |
| **Replay** — same key, same request payload, original already completed | The **original success status and body are returned again** (`202` for `POST /reports`); no second resource is created (BR-5). |
| **Reuse** — same key, *different* request payload | `409 IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`. |
| **In flight** — same key, original has not finished | `409 IDEMPOTENCY_IN_PROGRESS`; the client may retry shortly. |

⚠️ **A replay is not an error.** It returns the endpoint's own success status, not `409` — a client whose connection dropped mid-submission must be able to retry and learn the outcome, which a `409` with no resource id does not give it. `409` is reserved for the two cases where the server genuinely cannot honour the request: a key reused for different content (silently replaying it would discard a real second submission), and a key whose original is still running.

⚠️ **Payload equality is compared on the server's normalized view of the submission**, not on raw bytes, so key ordering and whitespace do not turn a legitimate retry into a `409`.

A request that fails validation does **not** consume its key: the client may correct the body and retry with the same key.

Replayed responses carry **`Idempotency-Replayed: true`**. Additive and safe to ignore, but it is the only way a client — or an operator reading a log — can tell a re-delivered acknowledgement from a first one, since by design the bodies are identical.

**Amended 2026-08-08 (T2.3) — the replay status code, which this section and §4.2/§6.3 previously
contradicted.** The original text said a replay "returns the original result (`200`/`201`)" while
§4.2 and §6.3 both listed `409` for "idempotency replay", and `POST /reports` answers `202` in any
case. Resolved as above: a **replay** returns the endpoint's own success status (`202` here), and
the `409` those two sections list is for **key reuse with a different payload** or an **in-flight**
original. All three sections now say the same thing, and the two `409` codes are named.

⚠️ **The retention window is deliberately not a number in this contract.** It is deployment
configuration (`IDEMPOTENCY_RETENTION_SECONDS`), on the same footing as rate-limit windows: a
client must treat a key as valid only for its own retry burst, and must not depend on a specific
duration. Outside the window a replay is indistinguishable from a first use and will create a
second resource.

---

## 5. API Versioning Strategy
- **URI versioning: `/api/v1`.** Chosen for explicitness, cache-friendliness, and ease of routing.
- **Additive changes are non-breaking** and ship within `v1` (new optional fields, new endpoints, new enum values behind capability flags). Clients MUST ignore unknown fields.
- **Breaking changes** (removing/renaming fields, changing semantics, e.g. adding **Critical** severity — Q2 RESOLVED: Critical is now part of the enum) are handled within `v1` when additive (new enum value clients must ignore-unknown); a `/api/v2` is triggered only if existing clients must change behavior to handle it. Clients MUST ignore unknown enum values to stay forward-compatible.
- **Deprecation signaling:** `Deprecation` and `Sunset` response headers on affected endpoints.

## 6. Endpoint Specifications

> Format per endpoint: Method · URL · Purpose · Auth · Authorization · Request (params/body) · Response · Errors. "Standard errors" = §4.3. All protected endpoints implicitly return `401` if unauthenticated and `429` if rate-limited.

---

### 6.1 Authentication & Session — `/auth`

#### `POST /auth/register`
- **Purpose:** Register a citizen account (FR-1).
- **Auth:** None.
- **Authorization:** Public.
- **Body:**
```json
{ "email": "user@example.com", "phone": "+8801XXXXXXXXX", "password": "…", "preferredLanguage": "bn" }
```
(At least one of `email`/`phone` required.)
- **Response `201`:** `{ "userId": "...", "verificationRequired": true, "channels": ["email"] }`
- **Errors:** `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `409 CONFLICT` (identity already registered), standard.

#### `POST /auth/verify`
- **Purpose:** Confirm email/phone via OTP or link code (FR-1).
- **Auth:** None (pre-session) or session.
- **Body:** `{ "channel": "phone", "code": "123456" }`
- **Response `200`:** `{ "verified": true }`
- **Errors:** `422` (code invalid/expired), `429` (too many attempts), standard.

#### `POST /auth/login`
- **Purpose:** Start a session (FR-1).
- **Auth:** None.
- **Body:** `{ "identifier": "email-or-phone", "password": "…" }`
- **Response `200`:** sets session cookie; body `{ "user": { "id", "role", "preferredLanguage" }, "requires2fa": false }`
- **Errors:** `401` (bad credentials — generic message, no user enumeration), `423`-equivalent surfaced as `403 ACCOUNT_LOCKED` (FR-4), `429`, standard.

⚠️ When `requires2fa` is `true` the cookie carries a **partial (post-password) session only**, and the
`user` object is omitted — the caller has proved the password but not the second factor, so no
identity is disclosed and no other endpoint accepts the cookie. Body in that case:
`{ "requires2fa": true }`. Complete with `POST /auth/2fa/verify`.

#### `POST /auth/2fa/enroll`
- **Purpose:** Begin TOTP enrolment for the calling account (FR-4).
- **Auth:** Session, **or** partial session (post-password) when the account is under a 2FA
  requirement it cannot yet satisfy. **Authorization:** Self — a caller may only enrol their own
  device; an Admin cannot enrol on another user's behalf.
- **Body:** none.
- **Response `201`:** `{ "secret": "BASE32…", "otpauthUri": "otpauth://totp/…", "confirmed": false }`
- **Errors:** `409 CONFLICT` (a confirmed device already exists — remove it before re-enrolling),
  `429`, standard.

⚠️ **The `secret` is returned exactly once, on this response, and is never readable again.** It is a
credential: never logged, never echoed, never exposed through any read endpoint or admin view. A
lost unconfirmed secret is replaced by re-enrolling, not recovered.

⚠️ The device is created **unconfirmed** and grants nothing until the first valid code is presented to
`POST /auth/2fa/verify`. Enrolling does not by itself turn 2FA on for the account.

#### `POST /auth/2fa/verify`
- **Purpose:** Complete 2FA for authority/admin (FR-4); also confirms a newly enrolled device.
- **Auth:** Partial session (post-password), or session when confirming an enrolment.
- **Body:** `{ "code": "…" }`
- **Response `200`:** full session established; `{ "user": { "id", "role", "preferredLanguage" }, "confirmed": true }`
- **Errors:** `422` (code invalid/expired, or no device enrolled), `429`, standard.

⚠️ **One endpoint, because the first valid code *is* the proof of enrolment.** A separate confirm
endpoint would accept the same input, check the same device, and reach the same conclusion. A code
verified against an unconfirmed device confirms it; against a confirmed device it completes login.

#### `POST /auth/logout`
- **Purpose:** Revoke current session (Architecture §8).
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Self.
- **Response `204`.**

#### `POST /auth/password/forgot` · `POST /auth/password/reset`
- **Purpose:** Initiate and complete password reset (FR-1).
- **Auth:** None.
- **Bodies:** `{ "identifier": "…" }` → then `{ "resetToken": "…", "newPassword": "…" }`
- **Delivery:** Email only, and only for an active account with a verified email. SMS is out of scope.
- **Responses:** `202` (always generic, no enumeration) / `200`.
- **Errors:** `422` (token invalid/expired), `429`, standard.

---

### 6.2 Users — `/users`

#### `GET /users/me`
- **Purpose:** Current user's profile, role, scope, verification state.
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Self.
- **Response `200`:**
```json
{ "id":"...", "role":"authority", "email":"...", "phone":"...",
  "verified": { "email": true, "phone": false },
  "categoryScope": ["roads","water_drainage"], "preferredLanguage":"en", "status":"active" }
```
- **Errors:** standard.

**Amended 2026-08-07 (T1.9) — the response shape is identical for all three roles.** The example
above shows an Authority; `email` and `phone` are each `null` when the account does not carry that
channel, and every field is present regardless of role.

⚠️ **`categoryScope` is always an array, and `[]` does not mean "permitted nothing".** It is the
stored scope rows, which only an Authority has:

| `role` | `categoryScope` | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| `authority` | the granted slugs | The **only** categories this account may view or act on (BR-26) |
| `authority` | `[]` | Provisioned but unscoped — can act on nothing until an Admin scopes it (BR-25) |
| `citizen` | `[]` | Not applicable — scope does not gate citizen actions |
| `admin` | `[]` | Not applicable — **Admins bypass scope entirely**, so this is unrestricted |

An Admin's `[]` and an unscoped Authority's `[]` are the same JSON and opposite permissions; `role`
is what disambiguates them. A client must not derive capability from this field alone. It is emitted
for every role rather than omitted or `null` so the response shape stays stable — the alternative
makes clients branch on `role` before they can read the body at all.

#### `PATCH /users/me`
- **Purpose:** Update own profile (contact, language). Contact changes re-trigger verification.
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Self.
- **Body:** `{ "phone": "…", "preferredLanguage": "bn" }`
- **Response `200`:** updated profile.
- **Errors:** `409` (identity in use), `VALIDATION_FAILED`, standard.

**Amended 2026-08-07 (T1.9) — the body above is exhaustive, and `email` is deliberately absent.**
`role`, `status` and `categoryScope` are administrative (§6.2 `PATCH /users/{id}`) and are rejected
here rather than ignored. Self-service **email** change is also excluded: it is the address a
password reset is sent to, so permitting it turns one live session into a permanent account
takeover. Changing it is an Admin action; this omission is a decision, not an oversight.

⚠️ **A new `phone` clears that channel's verification and issues a fresh code** (BR-30). The account
keeps working; the *channel* is unverified until the code is confirmed via `POST /auth/verify`, and
no notification is sent to it in the meantime. Setting `phone` to `null` is permitted only while the
account still has an email — the account must always retain at least one contact channel.

#### `DELETE /users/me`
- **Purpose:** Request account deletion; **PII anonymized**, public Issue records retained (P6, BR-33, C-14).
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Self.
- **Response `202`** (anonymization may be async).
- **Errors:** `403` (Authority/Admin — see below), standard.

**Amended 2026-08-07 (T1.9) — self-service deletion is Citizen-only.** Data-model §"Ownership &
Permissions" grants an Authority `RU` on its own account, not `D`; Authority accounts are
admin-provisioned (FR-2) and their grants are audited (BR-25), so their lifecycle ends with
`PATCH /users/{id} {"status":"deprovisioned"}`, not with the holder erasing an audited grant.
The same applies to an Admin, where self-deletion additionally risks removing the last account able
to provision anyone. P6's "users can request account + PII deletion" and the PRD's edge case both
name the **Citizen** case.

⚠️ **`202`, and the session is already gone when it is returned.** The status code reflects that
retained-record anonymization may extend past the response (P2/P3 add Reports and media); it does
**not** mean the account is still usable. Every session is revoked and the contact columns are
cleared before the response is written, so the caller cannot act again on the credential they just
used. Anonymization is **irreversible and has no undo endpoint** — the row is retained only so
public Issue history keeps a stable author reference (C-14).

#### `GET /users` *(admin)*
- **Purpose:** List/search accounts for administration.
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Admin.
- **Params:** `?role=&status=&q=` + pagination.
- **Response `200`:** collection of user summaries.
- **Errors:** `FORBIDDEN`, standard.

#### `POST /users/authorities` *(admin)*
- **Purpose:** **Provision an Authority account** and set category scope (FR-2, BR-25). Grant is audited (FR-32).
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Admin.
- **Body:** `{ "email":"...", "categoryScope":["roads"], "requireTwoFactor": true }`. Email is
  required because SMS delivery is out of scope; the verified mailbox is used to establish the
  Authority's first password through the password-reset flow.
- **Response `201`:** authority user summary.
- **Errors:** `409`, `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `FORBIDDEN`, standard.

#### `PATCH /users/{id}` *(admin)*
- **Purpose:** Change role/scope/status (suspend, deprovision) — each change audited (FR-32).
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Admin.
- **Body (examples):** `{ "status":"suspended" }` | `{ "categoryScope":["roads","electrical"] }`
- **Response `200`.**
- **Errors:** `422`, `FORBIDDEN`, standard.

> No `DELETE /users/{id}` hard-delete: deletion is anonymization (C-14). Admin deprovisions via `PATCH … {status:"deprovisioned"}`.

### 6.3 Reports — `/reports`

#### `POST /reports`
- **Purpose:** Submit a report; persists immediately, triage runs async (FR-5, NFR-3, Architecture §4).
- **Auth:** Session required (Q4 RESOLVED: login required for all submissions).
- **Authorization:** Citizen.
- **Headers:** `Idempotency-Key` (optional, BR-5 — semantics in §4.6).
- **Body:**
```json
{
  "description": "Large pothole near the hospital gate",
  "location": { "lng": 90.399, "lat": 23.777 },
  "category": "roads",          // optional; AI suggests (FR-10). Client-supplied is a hint only.
  "mediaIds": ["media_abc"],    // pre-uploaded via §6.4, optional
  "language": "bn"
}
```
- **Validation:** location required (BR-2); at least one of {media, adequate description} (BR-3); location must be inside city boundary (BR-35, `422 OUT_OF_CITY`); category (if given) must be in taxonomy (C-2).

**`mediaIds` constraints** (amended 2026-08-11, T2.4/T2.6 — the field was listed without saying what makes an id usable, so a client could only discover these by hitting them):
  - Each id must be **owned by the caller**, **not already attached** to another report, and not removed by moderation. Attachment is **single-use**: an id spent on one report cannot be reused on another.
  - A report may carry **at most `MEDIA_MAX_PER_REPORT` photos** (deployment configuration, default 5 — not contract). Exceeding it is `VALIDATION_FAILED` on this request, not on the upload — the cap is a property of the *report*, and `POST /media` cannot know which report a handle is destined for.
  - Any unusable id fails the whole submission rather than being silently dropped: a citizen who photographed a flooded street and got a report with no photos would have no way to tell. Repeating the same id *within one request* is not an error — duplicates collapse and count once.
- **Response `202`:**
```json
{ "reportId":"rep_123", "status":"processing", "issueId": null,
  "classification": { "state":"pending" } }
```
`issueId` and `classification` populate after async triage (poll via `GET`, or receive a notification).

An `Idempotency-Key` **replay returns this same `202` body verbatim** — the acknowledgement the original request received, not the report's current state. Current state is what `GET /reports/{id}` is for; a replay must stay deterministic so a retrying client cannot tell a delivered response from a re-delivered one. Replays carry `Idempotency-Replayed: true`.
- **Errors:** `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `422 OUT_OF_CITY`, `413`/`415` (if inline media), `409 IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED` / `409 IDEMPOTENCY_IN_PROGRESS` (§4.6 — a replay is **not** an error), standard.

#### `GET /reports/{id}`
- **Purpose:** Retrieve a report incl. classification result and its Issue link once triaged.
- **Auth:** Session or public (Q7 RESOLVED: public map and list visible to unauthenticated users).
- **Authorization:** Author (own), Authority (in scope), Admin, or public.
- **Response `200`:**
```json
{ "id":"rep_123", "authorId":"usr_x", "description":"…",
  "location": { "lng":90.399, "lat":23.777, "address":"…" },
  "media":[{ "id":"media_abc","state":"ready","url":"…","thumbnailUrl":"…" }],
  "classification": { "category":"roads","severitySignal":"high","confidence":0.92,"source":"llm" },
  "issueId":"iss_456", "status":"triaged", "createdAt":"…" }
```
`media[]` entries are the **same four-key media resource** §6.4 returns, so a client has one shape to
parse wherever a photo appears. `url` and `thumbnailUrl` are both `null` until the derivative worker
finishes (`state: "processing"`); entries removed by moderation are **omitted from the array**, not
listed with a `removed` state — the array is the public view, and §6.13 governs the removal.

`classification` is **always present**, with all four values `null` before triage (BR-9 makes an
unclassified report valid). A citizen's optional `category` hint fills `category` alone and leaves
`severitySignal`, `confidence` and `source` null — a hint is not a classification.
- **Errors:** `404`, `410` (moderated), `FORBIDDEN`, standard.

#### `GET /reports`
- **Purpose:** List **own** reports for tracking (FR-1 transparency); Authority/Admin variants via scope.
- **Auth:** Session. Unlike `GET /reports/{id}`, this endpoint is **not public** — the collection is defined by its caller, so there is no anonymous reading of it.
- **Authorization:** Citizen → own only; Authority → in-scope; Admin → all. Reports removed or hidden by moderation are excluded for **every** role. An unclassified report has no category and is therefore in no Authority's scope.
- **Params:** `?status=&category=&q=&nearLng=&nearLat=&radiusM=` + pagination; `sort` default `-createdAt`.
  - `status` and `category` take comma-separated values, each checked against its allowlist; an unknown value is `400`, not an empty page. A **retired** category is still filterable — reports classified before the retirement stay findable.
  - `nearLng`, `nearLat` and `radiusM` are **all-or-nothing**: a partial triple is `400` rather than a silently unfiltered list. `radiusM` is in metres and capped server-side (`REPORT_SEARCH_MAX_RADIUS_M`; an uncapped radius is a full spatial scan).
  - `sort` allowlist: `-createdAt` (default) and `createdAt`.
- **Response `200`:** collection of the `GET /reports/{id}` resource, in the `{data, page, meta}` envelope (§1.3).
- **Errors:** standard.

#### `PATCH /reports/{id}`
- **Purpose:** Limited edits **before triage** (description/category correction), and citizen category override at submission (FR-11).
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Author, **only while pre-triage** (BR: report edit constrained); Authority/Admin may re-categorize (FR-11).
  - The **author** may change `description` and `category`, and only while the report is pre-triage — afterwards it may already be clustered into an Issue an Authority is working, so the edit is `409 NOT_EDITABLE`.
  - An **Authority in scope**, or an **Admin**, may re-categorize **at any time** — that correction path is what FR-11 exists for. They may **not** change `description`: it is the citizen's account of what they saw, and an official rewriting it is not a correction (`403`). An **unclassified** report has no category and is therefore in no Authority's scope (`403`); Admins bypass scope.
- **Body:** `{ "description":"…", "category":"water_drainage" }`
  - Partial: send only what changes. An **empty body is `400`**, not a `200` no-op. Unknown fields are **refused**, not ignored.
  - **No `severity` field.** FR-11's "re-severity" is an **Issue-level** Authority override (§6.5) — severity never lives on a Report — so sending one here is `400` rather than a silent `200`.
  - `category` is a slug from the **active** taxonomy; an unknown or retired slug is `400`. `null` is refused: clearing a category is a request to re-run triage, which this endpoint does not do.
  - BR-3 is **re-checked** against the photos the report still has, so blanking the description of a report whose only photo was removed by moderation is `400`.
- **Response `200`:** the `GET /reports/{id}` resource. A human correction sets `classification.source` to `"citizen"` (author) or `"authority"` (Authority **or** Admin) and leaves `severitySignal` and `confidence` untouched.
- **Errors:** `409 NOT_EDITABLE` (already triaged), `400 VALIDATION_FAILED`, `403 FORBIDDEN`, `404`, `410` (moderated), standard. There is no reachable `422` on this endpoint — the only business-rule `422` in this resource is `OUT_OF_CITY`, and `PATCH` accepts no location.

> Reports are not deleted by citizens; removal is a moderation action on the Issue/Report by Admin (FR-31) — see §6.13.

### 6.4 Media — `/reports/{id}/media`, `/media`

#### `POST /media`
- **Purpose:** Upload a photo; returns a media handle to attach to a report (FR-7). Server compresses, thumbnails, **strips EXIF/GPS by default** (P3) asynchronously.
- **Auth:** Session required (Q4 RESOLVED: login required).
- **Authorization:** Citizen.
- **Request:** `multipart/form-data` with `file`. Enforce size/type limits (FR-7).

**Limits** (amended 2026-08-11, T2.4 — FR-7 said "enforce size/type limits" without naming them, leaving a client no way to pre-validate or to tell the three rejections apart):
  - **Size:** `413 PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` above `MEDIA_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` (deployment configuration, default 10 MiB — not contract). An **empty** part is `VALIDATION_FAILED`, not `413`: nothing was uploaded, so "take the photo again" would be the wrong instruction.
  - **Type:** `415 UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE` when the image is read successfully and its format is outside `MEDIA_ALLOWED_IMAGE_FORMATS` (default JPEG/PNG/WEBP) — e.g. a valid GIF or TIFF. The response names the accepted formats.
  - **Readability:** `422` when the bytes cannot be read as an image at all — a renamed PDF or executable, or a permitted format that is corrupt or truncated.
  - ⚠️ **The format is taken from the decoded image, never from `Content-Type` or the filename.** A correct JPEG mislabelled `image/png` is accepted; a `.jpg` that is really a PDF is `422` (nothing identified it as an image), not `415`. So the split a client should code against is *"we recognize this format and do not accept it"* (`415`, convert it) versus *"we could not read this"* (`422`, re-capture it).
  - One upload is one photo. There is no batch form; the per-report cap is enforced at attachment time (§6.3).
- **Response `202`:**
```json
{ "id":"media_abc", "state":"processing", "thumbnailUrl": null }
```
- **Errors:** `413 PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`, `415 UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE`, `422` (corrupt image), standard.

> *Alternative (ASSUMP, Architecture §10):* presigned direct-to-storage upload — `POST /media/upload-url` → client PUTs to storage → `POST /media/{id}/complete`. Offered as an extensibility path; not required at prototype scale.

#### `GET /media/{id}`
- **Purpose:** Fetch media metadata / processed URLs.
- **Auth/Authorization:** As owning report's visibility (Q7 RESOLVED: public).
- **Response `200`:** `{ "id","state":"ready","url":"…","thumbnailUrl":"…" }`
- **Errors:** `404`, `410` (moderated), standard.

#### `DELETE /media/{id}`
- **Purpose:** Remove a photo from a **pre-triage** report (author) or by moderation (admin).
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Author (pre-triage) or Admin (moderation, FR-31).
- **Response `204`.**
- **Errors:** `409 NOT_EDITABLE`, `FORBIDDEN`, standard.

---

### 6.5 Issues — `/issues` (the triage core)

#### `GET /issues`
- **Purpose:** The **authority work queue** — list Issues, severity-ranked (FR-22).
- **Auth:** Session or public (Q7 RESOLVED: public).
- **Authorization:** Authority → **within category scope** (BR-26); Admin → all; Citizen/public.
- **Params:**
  - Filters: `?category=&severity=high,medium&status=in_progress&assignedTo=me&bbox=minLng,minLat,maxLng,maxLat&nearLng=&nearLat=&radiusM=&openedAfter=&q=`
  - Sorting: `?sort=` allowlist `severity` (default, DESC), `age`, `-createdAt`, `corroborationCount`. Default: **severity DESC, then age** (FR-19, §5.1).
  - Pagination: cursor.
- **Response `200`:**
```json
{
  "data": [{
    "id":"iss_456", "primaryCategory":"roads",
    "severity": { "current":"high", "computed":"high", "overridden": null, "rationale":"phrases: 'danger','hospital'" },
    "status":"triaged", "assignedTo": null,
    "corroborationCount": 6,                      // derived, read-only (FR-16, C-10)
    "proximity": [ { "poiType":"hospital","name":"Dhaka Medical","distanceM":120 } ], // display-only (FR-17)
    "representativeLocation": { "lng":90.399,"lat":23.777 },
    "reportCount": 6, "openedAt":"…", "ageSeconds": 51600
  }],
  "page": { "nextCursor":"…","limit":20 }, "meta": { "count":20 }
}
```
- **Errors:** `FORBIDDEN` (out of scope), `VALIDATION_FAILED` (bad filter), standard.

#### `GET /issues/{id}`
- **Purpose:** Full issue detail incl. member reports, history pointers, context.
- **Auth:** Session or public (Q7 RESOLVED: public). **Authorization:** Authority (scope), Admin, Citizen/public.
- **Response `200`:** issue object (as above) plus `memberReports` (paged link), `severity` block, `duplicateOf` (nullable), public comments.
- **Errors:** `404`, `410`, `FORBIDDEN`, standard.

#### `GET /issues/{id}/reports`
- **Purpose:** Paginated member Reports of the issue (mass-event issues can be large — Architecture §14).
- **Auth/Authorization:** As issue visibility + scope.
- **Params:** pagination.
- **Response `200`:** collection of report summaries.

#### `PATCH /issues/{id}/status`
- **Purpose:** Advance/change Issue workflow status (FR-24, §6.3). Emits Status Event (BR-28) + Notification (BR-29).
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Authority (scope) / Admin only; **no one may advance past `Triaged` without this role** (BR-15).
- **Body:** `{ "toStatus":"in_progress", "reason":"crew dispatched", "publicNote": "Work has started." }`
  - `reason` required for `rejected`/`duplicate`/`insufficient_info`/`reopen` (BR-19).
  - For `duplicate`: `{ "toStatus":"duplicate", "duplicateOfIssueId":"iss_789", "reason":"…" }` (BR-17).
- **Validation:** transition must be legal per state machine (BR-16/C-7) else `409 INVALID_TRANSITION`.
- **Response `200`:** updated issue.
- **Errors:** `409 INVALID_TRANSITION`, `422` (missing required reason), `FORBIDDEN`, standard.
- **Q8 RESOLVED — Resolved definition:** Authority self-attestation. The transition to `resolved` requires only an authority action; no citizen confirmation is needed. **DM-Q8 RESOLVED — Reopen semantics:** Reopening creates a **new linked issue**; `toStatus:"reopen"` on a resolved/closed issue creates a new Issue linked to the original, rather than reactivating it.

#### `PATCH /issues/{id}/assignment`
- **Purpose:** Assign/unassign an Issue to an Authority (FR-24).
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Authority (self-assign within scope) / Admin (any).
- **Body:** `{ "assigneeId":"usr_auth_1" }` or `{ "assigneeId": null }`
- **Response `200`.**
- **Errors:** `422` (assignee out of category scope), `FORBIDDEN`, standard.

#### `PATCH /issues/{id}/severity`
- **Purpose:** **Authority severity override** (FR-20). Never overwrites computed value; both retained with actor + mandatory reason (BR-20/21, C-8).
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Authority (scope) / Admin only.
- **Body:** `{ "severity":"medium", "reason":"verified minor, no traffic risk" }`
- **Validation:** `reason` mandatory (`422` if absent); severity ∈ {Critical, High, Medium, Low} (Q2 RESOLVED).
- **Response `200`:** issue with `severity.overridden` populated and `severity.computed` unchanged.
- **Errors:** `422`, `FORBIDDEN`, standard.

#### `POST /issues/{id}/merge`
- **Purpose:** Merge this issue's cluster with another mis-clustered duplicate (FR-25).
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Authority (scope) / Admin.
- **Body:** `{ "mergeWithIssueId":"iss_789", "reason":"same pothole" }`
- **Response `200`:** surviving issue.
- **Errors:** `409` (illegal merge, e.g. closed issues), `FORBIDDEN`, standard.
- **DM-Q7 RESOLVED:** On merge, all member Reports and Confirmations re-attribute to the surviving Issue; severity recomputed as max of all members.

#### `POST /issues/{id}/split`
- **Purpose:** Split incorrectly-merged reports into a new issue (FR-25). Each side must retain ≥1 Report (BR-14/C-4).
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Authority (scope) / Admin.
- **Body:** `{ "reportIds":["rep_2","rep_5"], "reason":"different issue" }`
- **Response `201`:** new issue + updated original.
- **Errors:** `422` (would empty a side), `409`, `FORBIDDEN`, standard.
- **DM-Q7 RESOLVED:** On split, moved Reports carry their own data to the new Issue. A Confirmation
  moves only when its citizen authored one or more moved Reports and authored no Report remaining on
  the original Issue. Confirmations from citizens represented on both sides, and confirmation-only
  citizens, stay on the original because the request contains no evidence assigning them to one side.

> Issues are **not** created directly via the API — they are formed by async clustering (FR-18, Architecture §4.3). There is deliberately **no** `POST /issues`. Issues are also never hard-deleted; moderation hides content (FR-31).

---

### 6.6 Confirmations ("me-too") — `/issues/{id}/confirmations`

#### `POST /issues/{id}/confirmations`
- **Purpose:** Citizen confirms an issue affects them too (S3), feeding **distinct-reporter** corroboration (FR-16, BR-22).
- **Auth:** Session (anonymous confirmation not modeled; tied to distinct-reporter rule).
- **Authorization:** Citizen; **at most one per citizen per issue** (BR-23) → `409 ALREADY_CONFIRMED` on repeat.
- **Body:** none (or `{}`).
- **Response `201`:** `{ "issueId":"iss_456", "corroborationCount": 7 }`
- **Errors:** `409 ALREADY_CONFIRMED`, `404`, standard.

#### `DELETE /issues/{id}/confirmations/me`
- **Purpose:** Withdraw a confirmation (DM-Q5 RESOLVED: revocable).
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Confirming citizen.
- **Response `204`.**
- **Note:** Corroboration count decreases on withdrawal.

---

### 6.7 Comments — `/issues/{id}/comments`

#### `GET /issues/{id}/comments`
- **Purpose:** List comments. Public comments visible to citizens; **internal notes** only to Authority/Admin (FR-24).
- **Auth:** Session or public (Q7 RESOLVED: public). **Authorization:** visibility filter applied server-side by role.
- **Params:** pagination; `sort` default `createdAt`.
- **Response `200`:** collection with `visibility: "public"|"internal"`.

#### `POST /issues/{id}/comments`
- **Purpose:** Add a comment/public update or internal note (FR-24).
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Citizen → public only; Authority/Admin → public or internal (scope for authority).
- **Body:** `{ "body":"…", "visibility":"public" }` (citizens forced to `public`; `internal` requires authority/admin).
- **Response `201`.**
- **Errors:** `422`, `FORBIDDEN` (citizen requesting internal), standard.

#### `PATCH /issues/{id}/comments/{commentId}` · `DELETE …`
- **Purpose:** Edit own comment; delete (author own, or admin moderation FR-31).
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Author (own) / Admin.
- **Responses:** `200` / `204`.
- **Errors:** `FORBIDDEN`, `404`, standard.

---

### 6.8 Status history — `/issues/{id}/status-events`

#### `GET /issues/{id}/status-events`
- **Purpose:** Immutable transition history of the issue (§6.3, FR-32) — powers citizen tracking and time-to-resolution.
- **Auth:** Session or public (Q7 RESOLVED: public). **Authorization:** visibility filter applied server-side by role.
- **Response `200`:**
```json
{ "data":[ { "from":"triaged","to":"acknowledged","actorRole":"authority","reason":null,"at":"…" } ], "page": {…} }
```
- **Note:** append-only; **no POST/PATCH/DELETE** (C-9, BR-31).

---

### 6.9 Map & Analytics

#### `GET /map/issues`
- **Purpose:** Issues as **GeoJSON** for the map / hotspot view (FR-23). Server-side spatial aggregation at low zoom to bound payload (Architecture §5.2).
- **Auth:** Session/public (❓Q7). **Authorization:** scope/role; public subset for citizens.
- **Params:** `?bbox=minLng,minLat,maxLng,maxLat` (required), `?zoom=`, plus issue filters (`category`, `severity`, `status`). At low zoom returns aggregated cluster features; at high zoom, individual issues.
- **Response `200`:** GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` (features carry `severity`, `status`, `corroborationCount`, or cluster `count`).
- **Errors:** `VALIDATION_FAILED` (missing/oversized bbox), `FORBIDDEN`, standard.

#### `GET /analytics/summary`
- **Purpose:** Aggregate counts and operational metrics (FR-26): by category/severity/status/area, median time-to-resolution, open-vs-resolved trend.
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Authority (scope-limited aggregates) / Admin (all).
- **Params:** `?from=&to=&groupBy=category|severity|status|area&category=&bbox=`
- **Response `200`:** aggregate series/objects (read-only, derived).
- **Errors:** `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `FORBIDDEN`, standard.

---

### 6.10 Reference data (Admin-managed) — `/categories`, `/pois`, `/severity-keywords`, `/clustering-rules`

All are **admin-managed reference data** (FR-30, NFR-11, BR-34). Reads are broadly available (citizens need categories/POIs for display); writes are **Admin-only**.

#### Categories — `/categories`
- `GET /categories` — **Purpose:** taxonomy for forms/filters (§6.2). **Auth:** public/session. **Response:** `[{ "key":"roads","label":{"en":"Roads & Transport","bn":"…"},"active":true }]`.
- `POST /categories` *(Admin)* — create. **Body:** `{ "key":"…","label":{…} }`. `201`.
- `PATCH /categories/{key}` *(Admin)* — update/retire (`active:false`; historical refs retained). `200`.
- **Errors:** `FORBIDDEN`, `409` (duplicate key), `422`, standard. *(No hard delete — retire only.)*

#### Points of Interest — `/pois`
- `GET /pois` — **Auth:** session; **Params:** `?type=&bbox=&nearLng=&nearLat=&radiusM=` + pagination. Display/reference (FR-17).
- `POST /pois` *(Admin)* — **Body:** `{ "name":"…","type":"hospital","location":{"lng","lat"},"source":"osm" }`. `201`.
- `PATCH /pois/{id}` *(Admin)* — update/retire. `DELETE /pois/{id}` *(Admin)* — retire (soft). 
- **Errors:** `FORBIDDEN`, `422`, standard. *(POIs never affect severity — C-10.)*

#### Severity Keywords — `/severity-keywords` *(Admin)*
- `GET /severity-keywords` *(Authority/Admin)* — list bilingual keyword→severity mappings (FR-13a).
- `POST` / `PATCH /{id}` / `DELETE /{id}` *(Admin)* — manage fallback keywords. **Body:** `{ "term":"বন্যা","language":"bn","severity":"high","category":"water_drainage" }`.
- **Errors:** `FORBIDDEN`, `422`, standard.

#### Clustering Rules — `/clustering-rules` *(Admin)*
- `GET /clustering-rules` *(Admin)* — per-category radius/time-window (FR-18, ASSUMP-4).
- `POST` / `PATCH /{id}` *(Admin)* — **Body:** `{ "category":"roads","radiusM":50,"timeWindowHours":72 }`. Changes affect **future** clustering only (BR: Clustering Rule lifecycle).
- **Errors:** `FORBIDDEN`, `422`, standard.

#### City Boundary — `/meta/city-boundary`
- `GET /meta/city-boundary` — served-city polygon for client-side out-of-city hints (BR-35). **Auth:** public/session.
- `PUT /meta/city-boundary` *(Admin)* — set boundary. Single served city (PRD §2.2).

---

### 6.11 Notifications — `/notifications`

#### `GET /notifications`
- **Purpose:** List the current user's notifications (FR-27).
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Self only.
- **Params:** `?unread=true&type=` + pagination; default `-createdAt`.
- **Response `200`:** collection `{ "id","type","issueId","body","channel","read":false,"createdAt" }`.

#### `PATCH /notifications/{id}` · `POST /notifications/read-all`
- **Purpose:** Mark read (`{ "read": true }`) / mark all read.
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Self. **Response:** `200` / `204`.

#### `GET /notifications/stream`
- **Purpose:** **In-app real-time delivery via Server-Sent Events** (ASSUMP-3; websockets deemed unnecessary for the 1-min SLA). Client subscribes; server pushes new-notification events.
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Self.
- **Response:** `text/event-stream` (SSE); events reference notification IDs to fetch/patch.
- **Note:** This is the only "event endpoint." **Outbound webhooks to external/government systems are explicitly NOT provided** — external integration is a PRD §2.2 non-goal; adding them would introduce an unauthorized feature.

---

### 6.12 Notification Preferences — `/notification-preferences`

#### `GET /notification-preferences` · `PATCH /notification-preferences`
- **Purpose:** Read/update per-channel preferences and opt-outs (FR-28).
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Self.
- **Body (PATCH):** `{ "inApp": true, "email": true }`
  - Note: SMS is out of scope for this prototype; clients must not send an `sms` field.
- **Response `200`.**
- **Errors:** `VALIDATION_FAILED`, standard.

---

### 6.13 Moderation — under `/issues`, `/reports`, `/media`, `/comments`

Moderation (FR-31) is expressed as **actions on existing resources**, not a separate resource, keeping REST consistent. Each is Admin-only (Authority limited per §4.2) and **audited** (FR-32).

#### `POST /reports/{id}/moderation` · `POST /issues/{id}/moderation` · `POST /media/{id}/moderation` · `POST /issues/{id}/comments/{commentId}/moderation`
- **Purpose:** Hide/remove privacy-violating/abusive/illegal content (FR-31), reason logged.
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Admin (Authority limited).
- **Body:** `{ "action":"hide"|"remove", "reason":"exposes bystander faces" }`
- **Response `200`.** Subsequent public GETs return `410 Gone`.
- **Errors:** `FORBIDDEN`, `422` (missing reason), standard.

---

### 6.14 Audit — `/audit-events`

#### `GET /audit-events`
- **Purpose:** Query the append-only integrity log (FR-32, NFR-10).
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** **Admin** → all; **Authority** → **own actions only** (§4.2). Citizens: none.
- **Params:** `?actorId=&action=&targetType=&targetId=&from=&to=` + pagination.
- **Response `200`:** `{ "data":[ { "actorId","action","targetType","targetId","before","after","at" } ], "page": {…} }`
- **Note:** read-only; no write/modify endpoints (C-9, BR-31).

---

### 6.15 Exports — `/exports`

#### `POST /exports`
- **Purpose:** Generate a CSV/GeoJSON extract of reports/issues for the technical-report deliverable (NFR-12).
- **Auth:** Session. **Authorization:** Authority (scope-limited) / Admin.
- **Body:** `{ "resource":"issues"|"reports", "format":"csv"|"geojson", "filters": { "from":"…","category":"…","bbox":"…" } }`
- **Response `202`:** `{ "exportId":"exp_1","state":"processing" }` (async for large sets).
- **Errors:** `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `FORBIDDEN`, standard.

#### `GET /exports/{id}`
- **Purpose:** Poll export status / obtain download link.
- **Auth/Authorization:** creator / Admin.
- **Response `200`:** `{ "state":"ready","downloadUrl":"…","expiresAt":"…" }`

---

### 6.16 System — `/health`, `/meta`

- `GET /health` — **Purpose:** liveness/readiness incl. dependency degradation flags (LLM/geocoder up/fallback — NFR-4/9). **Auth:** none (or internal). **Response `200`/`503`.**
- `GET /meta/enums` — **Purpose:** machine-readable enums (severities, statuses, categories, notification types) so clients stay in sync as the taxonomy evolves. Severity enum is now **Critical / High / Medium / Low** (Q2 RESOLVED). **Auth:** public/session.

## 8. Security Considerations (API-level)

- **Transport:** HTTPS/TLS enforced; HSTS (NFR-5).
- **Session cookies:** `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite`; CSRF token on state-changing requests (§2).
- **AuthZ everywhere:** every mutating and sensitive-read endpoint checks role + scope server-side (FR-3, BR-27); scope leakage (Authority reading out-of-scope issues) returns `403`/`404` (avoid existence leaks).
- **No enumeration:** login, registration, and password-reset responses are generic; `404` is used to hide resources the caller may not see (Q7 RESOLVED: public map/list; exact-location exposure accepted).
- **Input validation** at the boundary for every body/param (NFR-5); reject unknown fields where strictness matters (config endpoints).
- **Object references** are opaque IDs; no IDOR via guessable identifiers.
- **File upload hardening:** type/size limits (413/415), server-side image processing, **EXIF/GPS stripped** (P3), content moderation path (FR-31).
- **PII minimization:** report text sent to the LLM is minimized (P7, A11); the API never returns another user's contact info.
- **Rate limiting & cost caps:** §4.5; LLM-triggering paths degrade to fallback rather than fail (FR-13a, NFR-13).
- **Auditability:** privileged actions (status, override, assignment, provisioning, moderation, reference-data) are all audited (FR-32).
- **Immutable histories:** status-events and audit-events expose no write endpoints (C-9).

## 9. Self-Review (Principal Architect)

*(Consistency, missing/redundant endpoints, security, and REST improvements. Advisory; no new features introduced — gaps that would require new business rules are surfaced as open questions, not invented.)*

### Consistency
- **Uniform envelope, pagination, error model, and auth** applied across all resources. ✅
- **Sub-resource nesting** (`/issues/{id}/comments|confirmations|status-events|reports`) is consistent and reflects Domain ownership. ✅
- **Actions modeled as PATCH on sub-state** (`/status`, `/assignment`, `/severity`) rather than ad-hoc verbs — REST-consistent and keeps the audit/notification triggers coherent. ✅

### Missing endpoints — considered and resolved
- **No `POST /issues`** — correct: Issues arise only from async clustering (FR-18). Documented deliberately, not an omission.
- **Report → Issue linkage** is exposed via `GET /reports/{id}` (`issueId`) and `GET /issues/{id}/reports` — no separate join endpoint needed.
- **Bulk status update** (FR-25 "bulk") — *gap:* the queue supports bulk operations in the PRD. Recommend a future `POST /issues/bulk-status` (additive, `v1`-safe) rather than inventing now; flagged so it isn't forgotten.
- **`GET /meta/enums`** added so clients absorb enum evolution (Critical severity now included — Q2 RESOLVED) without a breaking release.
- **`POST /auth/2fa/enroll` — AMENDED IN (2026-08-07, T1.7).** This spec shipped `POST /auth/2fa/verify`
  with no way to obtain a TOTP device, and did not list the absence here as deliberate. That made it a
  genuine gap, not a documented omission: `requireTwoFactor: true` (§6.2, stored by T1.6) was a
  permanent lockout, and `/auth/2fa/verify` was unreachable code. Enrolment is now §6.1. **Confirmation
  deliberately reuses `/auth/2fa/verify` rather than adding a third endpoint** — the first valid code is
  itself the proof the secret was received, so a separate `/confirm` would take the same input and reach
  the same conclusion.

### Redundant endpoints — checked
- Considered separate top-level `/confirmations` and `/comments` collections; **rejected** as redundant with the nested forms. Kept nested-only for a single clear ownership path.
- Considered `PUT` variants; **rejected** in favor of `PATCH` (partial, safer) — no full-replacement use case exists.

### Security concerns raised
- **Login required (Q4 RESOLVED)** — `POST /reports`/`POST /media` require a Citizen session. IP rate-limiting still applies for unauthenticated login/register attempts.
- **Public read (Q7 RESOLVED)** — exact coordinates are publicly visible. Privacy risk (P1) is accepted; EXIF is still stripped (P3) and PII in response bodies is minimized.
- **SMS is explicitly out of scope** for this prototype; supported channels are in-app and email. ✅
- **Export links** must be short-lived, signed URLs (`expiresAt`) to avoid data leakage of bulk PII/location.

### Open items — all resolved
- **DM-Q5 RESOLVED** — confirmations are revocable; `DELETE …/confirmations/me` enabled; count can decrease.
- **DM-Q7 RESOLVED** — merge re-attributes all Reports/Confirmations to surviving Issue; split moves Reports/Confirmations to new Issue.
- **Q8 / DM-Q8 RESOLVED** — Resolved = authority self-attestation; reopen = new linked Issue.
- **Q2 RESOLVED** — severity enum is Critical / High / Medium / Low.
- **Q4 RESOLVED** — login required for all writes.
- **Q7 RESOLVED** — public map and list.

### REST design improvements applied / recommended
- **Cursor pagination** over offset for the concurrently-mutated queue (§4.4). ✅ applied.
- **`202 Accepted` + polling / SSE** for async triage and exports rather than blocking — matches NFR-3. ✅ applied.
- **Capability discovery** via `/meta/enums` and `/health` degradation flags improves client resilience. ✅ applied.
- **Recommend (future, additive):** conditional requests (`ETag`/`If-Match`) on Issue mutations to prevent lost updates when two authorities edit concurrently (Architecture §11 optimistic locking) — introduce in `v1` as an optional header; not required for prototype.

### Open items forwarded (not invented here)
- **DM-Q5** — confirmation revocation → determines `DELETE …/confirmations/me` behavior and count monotonicity.
- **DM-Q7** — merge/split re-attribution → precise effect on member reports/confirmations.
- **DM-Q8 / PRD ❓Q8** — reopen semantics and the definition of "Resolved" → gating rule on `PATCH /issues/{id}/status`.
- **PRD ❓Q2** — Critical severity band → enum + potential `v2` client impact.
- **PRD ❓Q4 / ❓Q7** — anonymous reporting & public visibility → auth on report submission and public reads.

*End of `docs/04-api-specification.md` (v1.2). Contracts derive solely from the approved PRD, Architecture, and Domain Model; no new business rules were introduced, and the v1.2 revision changes no endpoint, payload, or status code — it records the ADR-001 framework decision and flags where DRF's defaults must be customised to match this spec (§1.3, §2, §4.1). Endpoints touching unresolved questions (❓Q2/Q4/Q7/Q8, DM-Q5/Q7/Q8) reference them explicitly and must be finalized before implementation. Next: `05-project-plan.md`.*
