# UrbanMend — Backend Development Roadmap & Project Plan

> The end-to-end plan for building the UrbanMend backend, sequenced to lay foundations before dependent features and to minimize rework. Derived entirely from the four approved planning documents.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Document** | `docs/05-project-plan.md` |
| **Version** | 1.2 (ASSUMP-1 resolved: task notes retargeted to Django + DRF per ADR-001) |
| **Status** | Planning phase — pending stakeholder sign-off |
| **Author role** | Principal Software Engineer & Technical Lead |
| **Date** | 2026-08-03 |
| **Source of truth** | `01-prd.md` (v1.2) · `02-architecture.md` (v1.2) · `03-data-model.md` · `04-api-specification.md` · `07-adr-001-app-framework.md` (ADR-001, Accepted) — all approved |
| **Scope** | Backend implementation roadmap only (API process + Worker process). Client/UI is out of scope. |

### Ground rules
- The four approved docs are the **single source of truth.** This plan schedules only work that traces to an existing `FR-x` / `NFR-x` / `BR-x` / API endpoint. It introduces **no new features or requirements.**
- Where sequencing depends on an **unresolved open question** (PRD `❓Qx`, DM-`Qx`, `ASSUMP-x`), it is listed as a **blocking dependency or decision gate**, not guessed.
- **No implementation code.** Tasks describe *what* to build and *in what order*, not *how* in code.
- **Estimates are relative** (complexity + rough effort in developer-days for a **2-engineer capstone team**), not calendar-fixed. Complexity: **Low / Medium / High**.

## 1. Project Objectives

| # | Objective | Traces to |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| O-1 | Deliver a production-quality backend that lets citizens submit civic issue reports (text + photo + location) reliably and fast. | FR-5–8, NFR-3 |
| O-2 | Automatically classify reports (category + severity signal) via a hosted LLM, with a deterministic keyword fallback that never blocks intake. | FR-9–13a, NFR-4/13 |
| O-3 | Cluster related reports into Issues and maintain correct Report↔Issue separation. | FR-18, Domain model |
| O-4 | Give authorities a severity-ranked queue, map, lifecycle workflow, assignment, and override — all RBAC-scoped and audited. | FR-14–26, FR-32 |
| O-5 | Notify citizens of status changes within SLA using a reliable (outbox-backed) delivery path. | FR-27–29, NFR-3 |
| O-6 | Enforce security, privacy (EXIF stripping, PII minimization), rate limiting, and cost control throughout. | NFR-5/13, P1–P7 |
| O-7 | Be demonstrable, testable, documented, and deployable for the capstone deliverable. | NFR-9–12 |

**Non-objectives (carried from PRD §2.2):** native apps, real municipal/government integration, dispatch, financial integration, multi-tenant, custom-trained ML model, weighted numeric priority scoring. These are **not** scheduled.

---

## 2. Guiding Principles for Sequencing

1. **Foundations first.** Platform, data layer, auth, and CI/CD precede any feature so later work builds on stable ground (minimizes rework).
2. **Respect the domain dependency chain.** `Report intake → Classification → Clustering → Issue triage → Notifications`. Classification **must** precede clustering (clustering matches on category — Architecture §4.2).
3. **Write path before read path.** Issues must exist before the queue/map/analytics that display them.
4. **Reliability primitives before the features that need them.** Async worker + transactional outbox land before notifications and heavy triage.
5. **Cross-cutting concerns are built in, not bolted on.** AuthZ, audit, rate limiting, and validation are part of each vertical slice, not a final phase.
6. **Every phase ends demonstrable.** Each milestone produces something runnable and testable end-to-end for its slice.

## 3. Development Phases (Logical Order)

                                                               ▼
        P6 Notifications & Outbox ─► P7 Read Paths (queue/map/analytics)
                                                               ▼
        P8 Moderation, Audit & Reference Data ─► P9 Export
                                                               ▼
        P10 Hardening, Security, Performance & Deployment Readiness
```

Phases are ordered by dependency, not by perceived importance. P6 and P7 can partially overlap once P5 is stable (both consume Issues), but P7 read paths depend on P5 status data being present.

## 4. Milestones & Deliverables (Overview)

| Milestone | Phase | Headline deliverable | Rough effort (2 devs) |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **M0** | P0 | Running skeleton: repo, CI/CD, DB+PostGIS, Redis, object store, health check, base API/Worker processes | ~1 sprint |
| **M1** | P1 | Registration, verification, sessions, RBAC, authority provisioning | ~1 sprint |
| **M2** | P2 | Report submission (async `202`), media upload + EXIF strip, own-report tracking | ~1.5 sprints |
| **M3** | P3 | Async classification with LLM adapter + keyword fallback + cost caps | ~1 sprint |
| **M4** | P4 | Concurrency-safe clustering into Issues; corroboration; proximity context | ~1.5 sprints |
| **M5** | P5 | Full issue lifecycle: status, assignment, severity override, merge/split | ~1.5 sprints |
| **M6** | P6 | Transactional outbox + notification dispatch (in-app/email) + SSE | ~1 sprint |
| **M7** | P7 | Severity-ranked queue, map (GeoJSON), analytics | ~1 sprint |

## 5. Phase-by-Phase Task Breakdown

Legend — **Cx** = complexity, **Dep** = depends on.

### P0 — Foundation (M0)

> **Stack note (ADR-001):** Django + DRF; Celery on Redis; GeoDjango. Development runs **in Docker** (`postgis/postgis`, `redis`, `minio`) because GeoDjango requires GDAL/GEOS system libraries — ⚠️ awkward to install natively on Windows, this team's platform. Containers are the development environment of record.

| Task | Cx | Dep | Notes / Traces |
|------|----|-----|----------------|
| T0.1 Monorepo/codebase layout for modular monolith (API + Worker share code) | Low | — | Architecture §2.1/§2.4 — Django project + one app per module; `services.py`/`selectors.py` convention from day one |
| T0.2 Provision PostgreSQL **+ PostGIS**, Redis, S3-compatible object store (local/dev) | Med | — | Architecture §2.2, NFR-1 — docker-compose (`postgis/postgis`, `redis`, `minio`) |
| T0.3 Config/secrets management, environment profiles (dev/stage/prod) | Med | T0.1 | NFR-5 — settings split (`base`/`dev`/`prod`) + `django-environ` |
| T0.4 Schema migration tooling + baseline migration framework | Med | T0.2 | Data model → schema — Django migrations; first migration enables the PostGIS extension |
| T0.5 CI pipeline (lint, test, migration check, build) | Med | T0.1 | NFR-9 — `ruff`/`mypy`/`pytest-django`; add a `makemigrations --check --dry-run` gate to catch model↔migration drift |
| T0.6 Base API process (routing, `/api/v1`, error envelope, request validation harness) | Med | T0.1 | API §4.1/§5 — DRF with a custom exception handler for the §4.1 envelope and cursor pagination as the default |
| T0.7 Base Worker process (job/queue consumer skeleton on Redis) | Med | T0.2 | Architecture §2.2 — Celery app sharing Django settings; same image, different entrypoint |
| T0.8 `GET /health` with dependency degradation flags | Low | T0.6 | API §6.16, NFR-4 |
| T0.9 Structured logging, correlation/trace IDs, error tracking | Med | T0.6 | API §4.1 `traceId` — `structlog` + middleware, propagated into Celery task headers |
| T0.10 Baseline schema for core entities (Users, Reports, Issues, Media, Categories) | High | T0.4 | Domain model — ⚠️ the **custom user model must be declared before the first migration** (irreversible afterwards) |

**DoD (M0):** CI green; API and Worker both boot; migrations apply cleanly from zero; `/health` reports each dependency; a trivial round-trip request works with the standard error envelope.

### P1 — Identity & Access (M1)
| Task | Cx | Dep | Traces |
|------|----|-----|--------|
| T1.1 User entity + roles (Citizen/Authority/Admin) + status states | Med | T0.10 | FR-1/2, Domain — custom `AUTH_USER_MODEL`, declared before the first migration |
| T1.2 Registration + email/phone verification (OTP/link) | Med | T1.1 | FR-1, `/auth/*` — Argon2 hashing (`argon2-cffi`), NFR-5 |
| T1.3 Server-validated sessions (cookie, `HttpOnly`/`Secure`/`SameSite`) + revocation | High | T1.1 | Arch §8, API §2 — Django sessions on the `cached_db` backend; revocation deletes session rows |
| T1.4 CSRF protection for state-changing requests | Med | T1.3 | API §2 — carried by DRF `SessionAuthentication` |
| T1.5 RBAC enforcement layer (role + authority category-scope checks) | High | T1.3 | FR-3, BR-26/27 — explicit `role` + category-scope relation checked in `services.py`; **not** `contrib.auth` Groups/Permissions (cannot express BR-26 scoping) |
| T1.6 Admin: provision authority accounts + set category scope | Med | T1.5 | FR-2, `/users/authorities` |
| T1.7 2FA for authority/admin (optional per policy) | Med | T1.3 | FR-4 — `django-otp` |
| T1.8 Login/OTP rate limiting + account lockout | Med | T1.2 | FR-4, NFR-13 — DRF throttling on the Redis cache backend |
| T1.9 Profile read/update, account deletion → **PII anonymization** | Med | T1.1 | P6, BR-33, C-14 |

**DoD (M1):** A citizen can register→verify→log in; an admin can provision a scope-limited authority; RBAC denies out-of-scope/role actions with `403`; sessions revoke immediately on logout/suspend; auth endpoints are rate-limited; auth flows covered by integration tests.

### P2 — Reporting & Media (M2)
| Task | Cx | Dep | Traces |
|------|----|-----|--------|
| T2.1 Report entity + validation (location required, media-or-description, in-city boundary) | Med | T1.5, T0.10 | FR-5/6, BR-2/3/35 — GeoDjango `PointField(geography=True, srid=4326)`; boundary via polygon containment |
| T2.2 `POST /reports` — synchronous fast write, returns `202 processing`, enqueue triage job | High | T2.1, T0.7 | FR-5, NFR-3, API §6.3 — ⚠️ enqueue via `transaction.on_commit` so the worker never sees an uncommitted Report |
| T2.3 Idempotency-Key handling for submission | Med | T2.2 | BR-5, API §4.6 — Redis-backed, resolved in the service before the write |
| T2.4 Media upload (`POST /media`), size/type limits, async processing | High | T0.2, T1.5 | FR-7, API §6.4 — `django-storages` to S3/MinIO |
| T2.5 **EXIF/GPS stripping** + compression + thumbnail generation (worker) | Med | T2.4, T0.7 | P3 — Pillow; orient via EXIF orientation **before** stripping |
| T2.6 Attach media to report; media lifecycle states | Low | T2.4, T2.1 | Domain |
| T2.7 `GET /reports/{id}` + `GET /reports` (own-report tracking, spatial/status filters) | Med | T2.1 | FR-1, API §6.3 |
| T2.8 Pre-triage report edit / re-categorize; edit-lock after triage | Med | T2.1 | FR-11, BR (edit window) |
| T2.9 Submission rate limiting (anti-spam) | Med | T2.2 | FR-33, T3 |

**DoD (M2):** A report with a photo can be submitted and returns `202` immediately; the photo is stored with EXIF stripped and a thumbnail generated asynchronously; a citizen can retrieve and track their own reports; out-of-city and invalid submissions are rejected with correct codes; duplicate submits are idempotent.

> **Q4 RESOLVED / DM-Q2 RESOLVED** — login required for all submissions; no anonymous reporting. T2.2 auth rules and T2.9 limits are finalized: authenticated-citizen session required.

### P3 — Classification (M3)
| Task | Cx | Dep | Traces |
|------|----|-----|--------|
| T3.1 `ClassificationService` interface (category + severity signal + confidence + source) | Med | — | Arch §6 — a plain ABC with **no Django imports**, keeping S1 provider-swappability and unit-testability |
| T3.2 Hosted **LLM adapter** (provider-agnostic) with PII-minimized prompts | High | T3.1 | FR-9–13, A11/P7 — provider chosen by settings |
| T3.3 Deterministic **keyword fallback** classifier (bilingual, admin-managed keywords) | Med | T3.1 | FR-13a — reads the `SeverityKeyword` reference table |
| T3.4 LLM **cost/rate cap** + graceful degradation to fallback (never blocks intake) | High | T3.2, T3.3 | NFR-13, RISK-3 |
| T3.5 Classification worker job: consume submission, classify, persist result on Report | High | T3.2, T2.2 | Arch §4, FR-10 |
| T3.6 Timeout/retry/circuit-breaker on LLM calls | Med | T3.2 | NFR-4, Arch §12 |
| T3.7 Confidence handling + low-confidence flagging for later review | Med | T3.5 | FR-12, ❓Q10 |

**DoD (M3):** A submitted report is classified asynchronously with category + severity signal; when the LLM is unavailable or over budget, the keyword fallback produces a result and submission still succeeds; classification source is recorded; LLM failures degrade rather than crash the pipeline.

> **Q9 RESOLVED** — LLM provider deferred; no-training-data policy locked; adapter stays provider-agnostic. T3.2 adapter abstraction is unblocked.
>
> **Addendum (2026-08-25) — the deferral is now spent: the provider is Google AI Studio** (Gemini via the native `generateContent` API). Chosen at implementation time exactly as this gate anticipated, so nothing in P3 changed shape: the vendor is selected per-environment with `CLASSIFICATION_LLM_PROVIDER=google_ai_studio` and the adapter stayed provider-agnostic, with `UnconfiguredLLMProvider` still the shipped default. ⚠️ **The no-training-data half of this gate is not satisfied by the choice alone** — Google's unpaid tier may train on submitted prompts (P7), so a deployment carrying real citizen reports needs a billing-enabled key, and no code can verify the tier. Setup and the smoke evaluation: `docs/10-llm-deployment-evaluation.md`.

### P4 — Clustering & Issues (M4)
| Task | Cx | Dep | Traces |
|------|----|-----|--------|
| T4.1 Issue entity + Report↔Issue relationship (severity/status/assignment on Issue only) | Med | T0.10 | Domain, BR |
| T4.2 Geospatial setup: `geography(Point,4326)`, GiST index, `ST_DWithin`/KNN queries | High | T0.2 | Arch §9, NFR-1 — GeoDjango `dwithin`/`Distance` annotations; GiST indexes in `Meta.indexes` |
| T4.3 Clustering rules (per-category radius/time-window), admin-managed | Med | T4.1 | FR-18, ASSUMP-4 — surfaced through Django admin |
| T4.4 **Concurrency-safe find-or-create** clustering (spatial+category lock, geohash cell) | High | T4.2, T3.5 | Arch §4.3, race-safety — Postgres **transaction-scoped advisory lock** keyed on geohash-cell + category, inside `atomic()` |
| T4.5 Clustering worker step: run after classification (category required first) | High | T4.4, T3.5 | Arch §4.2 |
| T4.6 Issue severity = **max of member reports**; recompute on new member; enum is **Critical / High / Medium / Low** (Q2 RESOLVED) | Med | T4.5 | FR-14, BR-... |
| T4.7 Confirmation ("me-too"): one per citizen per issue; derived corroboration count | Med | T4.1, T1.5 | FR-16, BR-22/23, C-10 |
| T4.8 Proximity context (POIs near issue) — **display-only, never affects severity** | Med | T4.2 | FR-17, C-10 |

**DoD (M4):** Two nearby same-category reports cluster into one Issue without creating duplicates under concurrent submission; Issue severity reflects the max of its members; corroboration count is derived and read-only; proximity context is computed for display only; clustering runs strictly after classification.

> **Q2 RESOLVED** — severity enum is Critical / High / Medium / Low. T4.6 enum is unblocked.

### P5 — Issue Triage Workflow (M5)
| Task | Cx | Dep | Traces |
|------|----|-----|--------|
| T5.1 Issue status state machine + transition validation; **reopen = new linked Issue** (Q8/DM-Q8 RESOLVED) | High | T4.1 | §6.3, BR-16, API §6.5 — transition map validated in the service layer; no FSM library (small transition set, custom reason-required rules) |
| T5.2 `PATCH /issues/{id}/status` (+ mandatory reason on reject/duplicate/etc.) | Med | T5.1 | FR-24, BR-19 |
| T5.3 Status Event emission (append-only history) | Med | T5.1 | FR-32, C-9 |
| T5.4 Assignment (`PATCH …/assignment`), scope-validated | Med | T5.1, T1.5 | FR-24, BR-26 |
| T5.5 **Severity override** (retains computed + override + actor + reason) | Med | T4.6 | FR-20, BR-20/21, C-8 |
| T5.6 Merge issues (+ reason) | High | T4.1 | FR-25 |
| T5.7 Split issues (each side keeps ≥1 report) | High | T4.1 | FR-25, BR-14/C-4 |
| T5.8 Internal vs public comments (RBAC-filtered) | Med | T1.5 | FR-24 |

**DoD (M5):** Authorities can move an Issue through its legal lifecycle (illegal transitions rejected with `409`), assign within scope, override severity with a mandatory reason (computed value preserved), and merge/split clusters; every transition writes an immutable status event; internal notes are hidden from citizens.

> **Q8 / DM-Q8 RESOLVED** — Resolved = authority self-attestation; reopen = new linked Issue (not reactivation). **DM-Q7 RESOLVED** — merge/split re-attributes all Reports/Confirmations to surviving Issue; severity recomputed as max. T5.1/T5.6/T5.7 are unblocked.

### P6 — Notifications & Outbox (M6)
| Task | Cx | Dep | Traces |
|------|----|-----|--------|
| T6.1 **Transactional outbox** (event written in same tx as state change) | High | T5.3 | Arch §7, reliability — a real table in the state-change transaction; an in-process commit hook alone cannot survive the crash this pattern guards against |
| T6.2 Outbox dispatcher worker (at-least-once, idempotent consumers) | High | T6.1, T0.7 | Arch §7 — Celery beat relay with row-level skip-locked reads; `transaction.on_commit` only nudges it for latency |
| T6.3 Notification entity + generation on status change | Med | T6.1 | FR-27/29, BR-29 |
| T6.4 In-app delivery + `GET /notifications` + mark-read | Med | T6.3 | FR-27 |
| T6.5 Email channel adapter | Med | T6.3 | FR-29 — Django email backend |
| T6.7 Notification preferences (in-app/email opt-outs) | Med | T6.4 | FR-28 |
| T6.8 SSE stream (`/notifications/stream`) for in-app real-time | Med | T6.4 | ASSUMP-3, API §6.11 — ⚠️ **requires the ASGI stack**; under WSGI each open stream pins a worker thread. Polling remains the ASSUMP-3-sanctioned fallback |

**DoD (M6):** A status change reliably produces a notification even across a worker crash (outbox replays); citizens receive in-app notifications within SLA; email works; preferences are honored; SSE pushes new notifications.

### P7 — Read Paths (M7)
| Task | Cx | Dep | Traces |
|------|----|-----|--------|
| T7.1 Authority **queue**: `GET /issues` sorted severity DESC then age, cursor pagination, scope filter | High | T5.1, T4.6 | FR-22, §5.1, API §4.4 |
| T7.2 Filtering/sorting/search allowlists on issues | Med | T7.1 | API §4.4 |
| T7.3 `GET /issues/{id}` detail + `GET /issues/{id}/reports` (paged members) | Med | T4.1 | API §6.5 |
| T7.4 Map endpoint `GET /map/issues` as GeoJSON + server-side aggregation at low zoom | High | T4.2 | FR-23, API §6.9 — `GeoFeatureModelSerializer`; low-zoom aggregation via `ST_SnapToGrid` |
| T7.5 Analytics `GET /analytics/summary` (counts, time-to-resolution, scope-limited) | Med | T5.3 | FR-26 |

**DoD (M7):** The queue returns correctly ranked, scope-filtered, paginated Issues; the map returns valid GeoJSON that aggregates at low zoom to bound payload; analytics reflect real status-event data; citizens see the public subset (**Q7 RESOLVED** — exact coordinates publicly visible).

> **Q7 RESOLVED / DM-Q3 RESOLVED** — public map and list confirmed; exact coordinates publicly visible; privacy risk P1 accepted. T7.1/T7.3/T7.4 public subset is unblocked.

### P8 — Moderation, Audit & Reference Data (M8)
| Task | Cx | Dep | Traces |
|------|----|-----|--------|
| T8.1 **Append-only audit log** for privileged actions + `GET /audit-events` | High | T5.x | FR-32, NFR-10, C-9 — enforce append-only **at the database level** by revoking UPDATE/DELETE from the application role; application discipline alone will not satisfy NFR-10 |
| T8.2 Moderation actions on report/issue/media/comment (hide/remove + reason → `410`) | Med | T5.8, T2.4 | FR-31 |
| T8.3 Reference data admin CRUD: categories, POIs, severity keywords, clustering rules | Med | T1.6 | FR-30, NFR-11 — largely Django admin; see §6 for the earlier-start note |
| T8.4 City boundary management endpoint | Low | T4.2 | BR-35 |
| T8.5 `GET /meta/enums` (severities/statuses/categories/types) for client sync | Low | — | API §6.16 |

**DoD (M8):** Every privileged action is audited immutably and queryable (admin: all; authority: own); moderated content returns `410`; admins manage all reference data; keyword/clustering-rule changes flow into P3/P4 behavior for future processing.

### P9 — Export (M9)
| Task | Cx | Dep | Traces |
|------|----|-----|--------|
| T9.1 Async export jobs (`POST /exports`, `GET /exports/{id}`), CSV/GeoJSON | Med | T7.5, T0.7 | NFR-12, API §6.15 — Celery job |
| T9.2 Short-lived signed download URLs (scope-limited data) | Med | T9.1 | API §9 security — presigned object-store URLs |

**DoD (M9):** Authorities/admins can request scope-limited exports that generate asynchronously and download via an expiring signed link.

### P10 — Hardening, Security, Performance & Deployment (M10)
| Task | Cx | Dep | Traces |
|------|----|-----|--------|
| T10.1 Global rate limiting + LLM cost-cap verification under load | High | all | NFR-13 |
| T10.2 Security review: authZ coverage, IDOR, enumeration, input validation, TLS/HSTS | High | all | API §8, NFR-5 |
| T10.3 Privacy review: EXIF, PII minimization to LLM, anonymization, PII in responses | Med | all | P1–P7 |
| T10.4 Performance/load test: submission throughput, queue/map query latency, geospatial indexes | High | P7 | NFR-1/2/3 |
| T10.5 Failure-mode drills: LLM down, worker crash, DB failover, outbox replay | Med | P6 | Arch §12 |
| T10.6 Observability: metrics, alerts on SLA/cost/queue-depth | Med | all | NFR-9 |
| T10.7 Deployment automation + rollback + migration-on-deploy strategy | High | T0.5 | NFR-9 |
| T10.8 Backups/restore drill for DB + object store | Med | T0.2 | NFR-10 |

**DoD (M10):** All checklists in §9 pass; system meets NFR latency/throughput targets under load; security and privacy reviews are clean; deploy + rollback + restore are rehearsed.

## 6. Consolidated Dependency Map & Critical Path

**Critical path (longest dependency chain):**
```
P0 foundation → P1 auth/RBAC → P2 report submission → P3 classification
→ P4 clustering → P5 triage workflow → P6 outbox+notifications → P7 read paths
→ P10 hardening/deploy
```

Key hard dependencies to respect (rework risks if violated):
- **Classification (P3) before Clustering (P4)** — clustering keys on category (Arch §4.2).
- **RBAC (P1) before any authority/admin feature** (P5–P9).
- **Issues (P4) before queue/map/analytics (P7)** — nothing to display otherwise.
- **Outbox (P6.1) before Notifications (P6.3+)** — reliability primitive first.
- **Status events (P5.3) before Analytics (P7.5)** — time-to-resolution derives from them.
- **Geospatial setup (P4.2) before clustering, map, and spatial filters.**

Parallelizable with 2 engineers:
- During P0/P1: one engineer on platform/CI (P0), the other on auth/data modeling.
- After P4: read paths (P7) and notifications (P6) can proceed in parallel once status events exist.
- Reference-data admin CRUD (P8.3) can begin early where its consumers (keywords P3.3, clustering rules P4.3) need it — build the config surfaces alongside the consumers. **Resolution (ADR-001):** with Django admin providing the surface, start the reference-data admin alongside its P3/P4 consumers instead of waiting for P8; the admin *management endpoints* are still completed in P8 (closes the §12 timing warning).

## 7. Risks & Mitigation Strategies

| ID | Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Phase |
|----|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| R-1 | LLM cost/latency spikes or outage (RISK-3) | Triage stalls / budget blown | Cost/rate caps + keyword fallback + circuit breaker; submission never blocks | P3 |
| R-2 | Duplicate Issues under concurrent submission | Data integrity, bad queue | Spatial+category lock find-or-create; test under concurrency early | P4 |
| R-3 | Notification loss on crash (SLA breach) | Citizen trust, FR-29 miss | Transactional outbox + at-least-once idempotent dispatch | P6 |
| R-4 | Geospatial performance at scale | Slow queue/map | PostGIS GiST indexes, `ST_DWithin`, server-side map aggregation, load test | P4/P7 |
| R-5 | ~~Unresolved open questions block phases~~ **Q2/Q4/Q7/Q8/Q9/DM-Q5/DM-Q7/DM-Q8 all RESOLVED** — gates closed; only ❓Q10 (accuracy bar) remains open | Rework / stalls | Decision gates in §10 with owners; isolate affected branches behind abstractions | All |
| R-6 | RBAC/authZ gaps (privilege escalation, IDOR) | Security breach | AuthZ built per-slice + dedicated security review; opaque IDs; `404`-hiding | P1/P10 |

## 8. Testing & Documentation Checkpoints

### 8.1 Testing checkpoints (per phase)
| Phase | Testing focus |
|-------|---------------|
| P0 | Migration up/down, CI gate, health check, config loading; **write the P4 clustering-concurrency test as a failing test** (R-2 is most expensive to discover late) |
| P1 | Auth flows, session revocation, RBAC allow/deny matrix, rate-limit/lockout |
| P2 | Submission validation, `202` async contract, idempotency, EXIF-strip verification, upload limits |
| P3 | Classification result shape, **fallback triggers when LLM down/over-budget**, cost-cap behavior, bilingual inputs |
| P4 | **Concurrency test** for find-or-create (no duplicate Issues), severity=max, corroboration count derivation, spatial query correctness |
| P5 | State-machine legal/illegal transitions, mandatory-reason enforcement, override retains computed value, merge/split invariants |
| P6 | Outbox replay after simulated crash, at-least-once idempotency, preference honoring, email delivery, SSE delivery |
| P7 | Queue ordering (severity→age), cursor pagination stability under mutation, GeoJSON/map aggregation, analytics accuracy |
| P8 | Audit immutability & completeness, moderation `410`, reference-data propagation |
| P9 | Export correctness, signed-URL expiry, scope limiting |
| P10 | Load/perf vs NFR targets, security & privacy review, failure-mode drills, backup restore |

**Standing test requirements (all phases):** unit + integration tests in CI (`pytest-django` + `factory_boy`); contract tests against the API spec (§04) so responses match documented schemas/status codes; regression suite grows each phase.

### 8.2 Documentation checkpoints
| Checkpoint | When | Content |
|-----------|------|---------|
| DC-1 | End P0 | Environment/setup + runbook skeleton; migration guide |
| DC-2 | End P1 | Auth & RBAC docs; role/scope matrix confirmed against PRD §4.2 |
| DC-3 | Per feature phase | Update API reference to match implementation; note any deviation back to the spec (spec is source of truth — if code must differ, the spec is amended first) |
| DC-4 | End P3/P4 | Triage pipeline operational doc (classification, fallback, clustering behavior, tuning knobs) |
| DC-5 | End P6 | Notification/outbox operations + SLA monitoring |
| DC-6 | End P10 | Deployment runbook, rollback, restore, on-call/observability guide |
| DC-7 | Continuous | Open-question resolution log (§10) — record each decision and the doc it updated |

## 12. Self-Review (Principal Engineer / Tech Lead)

*(Verifying order correctness, respected dependencies, no implementation gaps, and realism/maintainability — as required.)*

### Are tasks in the correct order?
- ✅ Foundations (P0) and auth/RBAC (P1) precede all features. Reliability primitives (outbox P6.1) precede notification features. Read paths (P7) follow the write path (P4/P5). No feature depends on something scheduled later.
- ✅ The **classification-before-clustering** invariant (Arch §4.2) is encoded as P3→P4 and as an explicit critical-path note.

### Are dependencies respected?
- ✅ §6 maps hard dependencies; each task lists `Dep`. Geospatial setup (P4.2) precedes every spatial consumer. Status events (P5.3) precede analytics (P7.5). RBAC precedes all privileged features.
- ✅ **Reference data timing** (was ⚠️): severity keywords (P3.3) and clustering rules (P4.3) need admin CRUD (P8.3). Resolved by building the *config surfaces* alongside their consumers in P3/P4 and completing the *admin management UX/endpoints* in P8 — flagged in §6 so it isn't missed. Django admin (ADR-001) makes the early surface nearly free, so this is now a scheduled resolution rather than an open tension.

### Any implementation gaps?
- ✅ Every approved API resource and FR maps to a task (traceability columns throughout). Cross-cutting concerns (validation, rate limiting, audit, privacy) are embedded per phase, not deferred.
- ✅ Deliberate non-tasks are explicit: **no `POST /issues`** (Issues arise from clustering), no scoring engine, no external webhooks — consistent with the approved docs, so their absence is intentional, not a gap.
- ⚠️ **Bulk status update** (noted in API §9 self-review as a future additive endpoint) is intentionally **not** scheduled to avoid introducing scope; recorded here so it is a conscious deferral, not an oversight.

### Is the plan realistic and maintainable?
- ✅ Estimates are relative and sized for a 2-person team; P8/P9 are identified as trimmable if the timeline compresses, without touching the core pipeline (MVP protection).
- ✅ Open questions are handled as **decision gates behind abstractions** (§10), so late answers are additive — directly serving the "minimize rework" objective. **All 8 gates are now closed** (Q2/Q4/Q7/Q8/Q9/DM-Q5/DM-Q7/DM-Q8 RESOLVED); only ❓Q10 (accuracy bar) remains open.
- ⚠️ **Biggest realism risk** remains bandwidth (R-10): the critical path P0→P10 is long for two people. Mitigation: strict MVP ordering, parallelizable P6/P7, and deferrable P8/P9. Recommend the team confirm which SHOULD/COULD FRs are in-scope for the defense before P5, so late phases can be cut cleanly rather than rushed.

### Improvements applied in this revision
- Added explicit **decision gates with owners** (§10) tied to the phases they block.
- Embedded **contract testing against the API spec** as a standing requirement so implementation cannot silently drift from doc 04.
- Made **reference-data sequencing** explicit to avoid a hidden P3/P4 ↔ P8 dependency.

## 13. Open Items — All Resolved

All 8 decision gates collected during planning are now closed. Decisions are encoded inline throughout this document (§5 phase notes, §10 table, §7 risk register).

- **Q2 RESOLVED** — severity enum is Critical / High / Medium / Low.
- **Q4 RESOLVED** — login required for all writes; no anonymous reporting.
- **Q7 RESOLVED** — public map and list; exact coordinates visible; privacy risk P1 accepted.
- **Q8 / DM-Q8 RESOLVED** — Resolved = authority self-attestation; reopen = new linked Issue.
- **Q9 RESOLVED** — LLM provider deferred; no-training-data policy locked; adapter stays provider-agnostic. **Deferral spent 2026-08-25: the provider is Google AI Studio** (Gemini, native `generateContent`), selected per-environment; ⚠️ the no-training-data half needs a **billing-enabled** key (P7) and is not enforceable in code. See §P3's addendum.
- **DM-Q5 RESOLVED** — confirmations are revocable; `DELETE …/confirmations/me` enabled; count can decrease.
- **DM-Q7 RESOLVED** — merge/split re-attributes all Reports/Confirmations to surviving Issue; severity recomputed as max.
- **DM-Q3 RESOLVED** — (via Q7) public map and list confirmed.
- **ASSUMP-1 RESOLVED (ADR-001)** — app framework is Python + Django + DRF; task notes in §5 are retargeted accordingly.

Only ❓Q10 (accuracy bar / confidence thresholds) remains open; it does not block the adapter abstraction (T3.2).

*End of `docs/05-project-plan.md` (v1.2). This roadmap schedules only work traceable to the approved PRD, Architecture, Domain Model, API Specification, and ADR-001; it introduces no new features or requirements — the Django notes added in v1.2 record how existing tasks are implemented, not what is built. All 8 open-question decision gates (Q2/Q4/Q7/Q8/Q9/DM-Q5/DM-Q7/DM-Q8) are closed (§10), and ASSUMP-1 is resolved by ADR-001; only ❓Q10 (accuracy bar) remains open.*
