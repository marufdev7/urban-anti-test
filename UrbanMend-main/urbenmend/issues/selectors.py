    works under a `LIMIT`.** On the queue it runs for the 20 rows of one page and costs nothing. The

    1 382 ms, of which **1 334 ms was this one annotation** — 97%, against 13 ms for the same rows

    keyset cursor's `WHERE`, which a property cannot serve.

    ⚠️ **The aliases must not collide with the property names.** Django assigns each annotation onto
    the model instance with `setattr`, and a property with no setter turns that into an
    `AttributeError` on the first row fetched. Hence `current_severity_band`, `report_total` and
    `corroboration_total`.

    ⚠️ **`SEVERITY_RANK` is the source of the `When` clauses, never a second hand-written mapping**
    — two mappings would agree until a band was added to one of them. Ordering is the single use
    that constant's comment sanctions ("nothing more"); the rank is a sort key and is never
    serialized, so no numeric priority score becomes visible (FR-21, C-10).

    ⚠️ **Both counts are correlated subqueries, not `Count()` over a join.** A join aggregate forces
    a `GROUP BY` on the outer query, which interacts badly with the keyset `LIMIT`, and it would put
    the count in `HAVING` — where a cursor predicate cannot reach it. As a `Subquery` the value is an
    ordinary scalar expression usable in `WHERE`, which is what makes `?sort=corroborationCount`
    pageable at all.

    ⚠️ **`with_counts=False` is for callers with no `LIMIT`, and it is not tuning.** The paragraph
    above is the reasoning for a *paginated* read; a correlated subquery evaluated once per row is
    only cheap because a page holds 20 rows. `GET /map/issues` renders every Issue in a bbox, where
    the same two subqueries dominate the response (measurements in `corroboration_counts()`), so it
    opts out and reads corroboration through that selector instead. The two cheap annotations stay in
