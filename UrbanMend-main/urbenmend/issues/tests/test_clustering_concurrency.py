"""
P4 clustering-concurrency test — R-2's acceptance criterion, written in P0 (A10, T4.4).

✅ T4.4 now implements the service this acceptance test pins. The test remains focused on the
race rather than duplicating the find-or-create implementation inline.
[doc: Plan §8.1, P0 checkpoint]: R-2 ("duplicate Issues under concurrent submission", Plan §risks)
is the single most expensive defect to discover late, so the acceptance criteria are locked into
the suite *before* the schedule pressure that would otherwise trim them.

It encodes the Arch §4.3 contract and nothing more:

    the find-or-create runs inside a single DB transaction guarded by a lock keyed on a
    coarse spatial+category bucket (e.g. a geohash cell + category) ... 1. ST_DWithin query
    for an **open** Issue of the same category within the configured radius and time window.
    2. If found -> attach; if not -> create new Issue.

✅ The test calls `cluster_report()` rather than inlining a find-or-create.
An inlined version would only ever test itself, and would still pass in P4 while the real
service raced. The seam asserted here is the one T4.4 must implement.
