Classification — Category taxonomy (T0.10, ❓Q1 RESOLVED 2026-08-07).

⚠️ The seed migration *is* the taxonomy — PRD §6.2's seven nodes, confirmed as Q1's answer.
Restating that list here and asserting equality is deliberately the one tautology worth keeping:
it makes any future edit to the applied migration, or a stray node added by a later one, fail
loudly. The remaining tests check properties the list itself cannot express.
