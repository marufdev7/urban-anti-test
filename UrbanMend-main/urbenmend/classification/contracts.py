"""
Classification — the provider-facing contract (T3.1).

The single interface every classifier implements: the hosted-LLM adapter (T3.2), the
deterministic keyword fallback (T3.3), and any future vision adapter (FR-13). S1's whole claim is
that the provider is swappable "without touching callers", and that claim is only true if callers
depend on *this* module rather than on any implementation [doc: Arch §6, plan T3.1].

⚠️ **No Django imports in this module, and none in the implementations' engines either.** This is
the load-bearing constraint of T3.1, not a stylistic preference:

  - It is what makes a classifier unit-testable with no database, no settings and no app registry —
    the difference between a test that asserts "'live wire' means critical" in microseconds and one
    that migrates PostGIS first.
  - It is what keeps the provider swap honest. A classifier that reaches for `settings` or runs a
    query has bound itself to this deployment, and S1's "swap the provider" becomes "swap the
    provider and re-wire its data access".
  - It is why the taxonomy arrives as `ClassificationRequest.allowed_categories` instead of being
    queried: the allowed set lives in the `classification_category` table (NFR-11 — taxonomy is
    data, not code), so a Django-free classifier *cannot* read it and the caller must pass it. The
    apparent inconvenience is the constraint doing its job.

⚠️ **`Severity` duplicates `reporting.models.SeveritySignal`, knowingly.** `SeveritySignal` is a
`models.TextChoices` and therefore a Django import; the two cannot be the same object while this
module stays Django-free. The duplication is paid for with
`tests/test_contracts.py::test_severity_matches_the_persisted_enum`, which asserts both the member
values *and* their precedence order against the persisted enum in both directions. Do not "fix"
the duplication by importing from `reporting` — that trades an asserted invariant for a broken one.

    holds one statement of the ordering rather than an enum plus a rank table that can disagree.
    Alphabetizing these members — the obvious tidy-up, and what an editor's "sort members" action
    does — silently inverts triage: BR-11's "highest severity among member reports" would start
    returning the *least* severe, and no test outside `test_contracts.py` would notice.

    ⚠️ **`StrEnum`, not `(str, Enum)`.** These values are written into a `CharField` and compared
    against strings read back from Postgres. Under a `(str, Enum)` mixin, `str(Severity.HIGH)` is
    `"Severity.HIGH"`, so any f-string or `str()` on the way to the database stores a value that
    matches no row and no choice — while `==` against `"high"` keeps working, which is exactly the
    combination that survives unit tests and fails in production.
