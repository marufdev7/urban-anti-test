"""
Health endpoint tests (A8, T0.8).

`GET /api/v1/health` is the K8s readiness probe target, so its status code has operational
consequences: a 503 pulls the pod out of the load balancer [doc: DevOps §8.4]. These assert the
required/optional split has teeth in both directions — a required failure must evict, and an
optional one must not.

⚠️ No `django_db` marker anywhere. The probes are exercised against patched checks rather than a
live connection: A7 is outstanding, so a real DB-backed request would error for an unrelated
reason. The connection itself is `check_database`'s one line of code and is covered by the
integration stage once migrations exist.
