"""
Platform (cross-cutting) — read operations.

Query functions for this module. Kept separate from services.py so reads never acquire
write-path side effects, and so the modules that consume this one have a single documented
surface to call [doc: Arch §3.1].

Rules for this file:
  - No writes, no `transaction.atomic`, no task enqueue.
  - Apply the caller's visibility rules here — a selector that returns rows the actor may
    not see is an authorization bug even though it wrote nothing [doc: Arch §3.1, FR-3].
  - Return querysets or domain objects, never DRF serializers or HTTP responses.

Currently holds the dependency probes behind `GET /api/v1/health` (A8, T0.8).

⚠️ **Which dependencies count as required has teeth.** The K8s readiness probe uses that
endpoint, and "a degraded dependency (e.g. Redis down) marks the pod not-ready and stops
traffic routing to it" [doc: DevOps §8.4]. Marking an *optional* dependency required would
take the deployment out of service for a failure NFR-4 says must only degrade a feature. The
split below follows the Arch §12 failure table.

    ⚠️ Deliberately short, and it stays short now that classification is built. API §6.16 asks for

    the LLM deliberately gets no probe here even though ❓Q9 is resolved (Google AI Studio) and the
    adapter exists. Two reasons, both structural rather than schedule: a truthful probe means a live
    billed request on every readiness check, and — decisively — under NFR-4/FR-13a an unreachable
    provider is *not* an unready service, because the keyword fallback carries the triage. Wiring the
    LLM into the probe the readiness gate reads would take the pod out of rotation for a condition the
    product is designed to absorb. The §6.16 flags therefore remain an open gap, recorded in
    docs/13-build-status.md, not something to fill with `"llm": "ok"`.
