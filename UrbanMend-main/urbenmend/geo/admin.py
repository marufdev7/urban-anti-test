Geospatial — Django admin registrations.

Reference data and moderation tooling are surfaced through admin [doc: Arch §2.4, FR-30/31].
The `CityBoundary` editor is the operator-facing half of "the boundary is data, not code"
(NFR-11, BR-34): swapping a served-city polygon must not require a deploy.

    other tables key on, so it is migration-only; a boundary is a single opaque polygon nothing
    references by value, and `docs/city-boundary/README.md` documents replacement as an admin
    operation. Barring add here would make the documented swap impossible without a deploy —
    exactly what NFR-11 rules out.

    polygon in place rewrites the record of why past reports were accepted or rejected (`202`
    vs. `422 OUT_OF_CITY`); a new row plus an `is_active` flip keeps both decisions explainable.
    `is_active` stays editable — that flip *is* the retirement.
