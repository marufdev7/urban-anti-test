Identity & Access — persistence.

The custom user model. **Declared before the first migration and irreversible afterwards**
[doc: Plan T0.10/T1.1, Arch §2.4] — changing `AUTH_USER_MODEL` later means dropping the
database and starting over.

Authorization model [doc: Arch §2.4, Plan T1.5, BR-26]: an explicit `role` field plus an
authority↔category scope relation, evaluated in `services.py`. `django.contrib.auth`
Groups/Permissions are deliberately **not** the RBAC mechanism — they cannot express the
per-category scoping BR-26 requires.

⚠️ `PermissionsMixin` is nonetheless inherited, because Django admin needs `is_staff`,
`is_superuser` and `has_perm()` to function at all, and FR-30/31 surface reference data and
moderation through admin. That is admin plumbing only. Domain authorization — who may see or
act on which Issue — is decided by `role` + category scope in the service layer, never by a
Group. Do not put domain RBAC in `groups` or `user_permissions`.
