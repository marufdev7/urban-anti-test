Identity & Access — HTTP layer (T1.2).

⚠️ Views are thin by mandate [doc: workflow §B7, FR-3, R-12]. Every rule below lives in
`services.py`; this module parses the request, calls one service function, and shapes the
response. A rule that appears here is a defect, not a shortcut — DRF permission classes are
defence-in-depth, never the enforcement point.

Service exceptions are translated to the API §4.1 error envelope by raising DRF exceptions
with the spec's `code`; the T0.6 handler renders them.
