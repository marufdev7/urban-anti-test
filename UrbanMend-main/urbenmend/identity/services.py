"""
Identity & Access — write operations.

Every state change and every authorization check for this module lives here. This file
exists from day one even while empty: R-12 is the risk that "service-layer discipline
erodes under Django's idiom, scattering authorization into views/serializers", and the
named mitigation is that the convention is already in place, so putting a rule in a view
is never the path of least resistance.

Rules for this file [doc: Arch §3.1, FR-3]:
  - Callers pass the acting user; functions authorize before mutating. DRF permission
    classes are defence-in-depth, never the enforcement point.
  - Wrap multi-write operations in `transaction.atomic`.
  - Enqueue Celery tasks via `transaction.on_commit` so a worker cannot observe an
    uncommitted row [doc: Arch §2.4, §4.1].
  - Reads belong in selectors.py.

    anonymized (BR-33, C-14), and their live sessions must stop working *now*, not whenever
    a token happens to expire. A stateless token cannot do this without a revocation list,
    which is a session table wearing a disguise.

    ⚠️ **Deleting the `django_session` rows directly is NOT sufficient on the `cached_db`
    backend, and doing so is a silent security hole.** `cached_db.SessionStore.load()` reads
    Redis first and only falls back to the table on a miss, so a session whose row is gone
    but whose cache entry is still warm keeps authenticating until the cache expires — up to
    `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` later. Going through `SessionStore(key).delete()` removes both
    copies. A `Session.objects.filter(...).delete()` would pass a naive test (the row really
    is gone) while leaving the session live.

    ⚠️ **Sessions are scanned, not queried by user.** `django_session` stores the user id
    inside the opaque encoded blob with no column or index for it, so there is nothing to
    filter on — every unexpired row has to be decoded. That is acceptable because this runs
    on suspension and deletion, not per request. If the table ever grows enough for this to
    hurt, the fix is a `user`-keyed index table written at login, not a query against this

# ⚠️ **The partial session deliberately does NOT call `django_login()`.** It writes one key into
# an anonymous session and nothing else, so `SESSION_KEY` (`_auth_user_id`) stays unset,
# `AuthenticationMiddleware` resolves `request.user` to `AnonymousUser`, and every endpoint in
# the project that requires authentication rejects the cookie with `401` — automatically, with
# no per-view opt-in. That is the whole design: a caller who has proved only the password holds
# a credential that unlocks `/auth/2fa/*` and nothing else.
#
# ⚠️ **django-otp's `otp_required` decorator model was considered and rejected for this.** It
# logs the user fully in first and then gates individual views, so a view added later without
# the decorator is reachable with one factor. It fails open; the missing-`_auth_user_id`
# approach fails closed. `OTPMiddleware` stays in the stack (it attaches `request.user.otp_device`
# and costs nothing), but it is not the enforcement point here.
