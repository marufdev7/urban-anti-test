    async triage (the classification block, FR-10). An admin edit to either would be an
    unattributed rewrite of someone else's submission — FR-11's correction path is the API, which
    records `classification_source = authority`, and moderation is FR-31's hide/remove, not a
    form edit. `has_add_permission` is false for the same reason: a hand-made Report would have
    an author who never submitted it.

    ⚠️ **`status` is not editable here either.** It is the Report's *processing* lifecycle, driven
    by the classification-then-clustering worker (T3.5/T4.5); setting it by hand would strand a
    row as `triaged` with no Issue, or re-queue one that is already classified.

    ⚠️ **No delete** (database.md "No hard deletes") — a removed Report takes an Issue's
    corroboration count (FR-16) with it. Moderation sets `status = removed` and the read returns
    `410` (API §4.2).
