"""
Reporting — HTTP layer (T2.2 submit, T2.7 read, T2.8 edit, T2.9 submission throttling).

Views stay thin (Arch §2.4, R-12/DC-3): parse, call the service or selector, render. Every rule
these endpoints enforce — Citizen-only, BR-2, BR-3, BR-35, the per-role visibility of the list, and
the author-pre-triage vs. official-re-categorize split on `PATCH` — lives in `reporting/services.py`
and `reporting/selectors.py`, which are the enforcement points (FR-3).

    one `path()` is not expressible in Django's router; splitting them would need a dispatching
    wrapper whose only job is to undo the split.

    ⚠️ **Both verbs require a session, but for different reasons, and only one is public-adjacent.**
    `GET /reports/{id}` is public (Q7) — the *collection* is not, because there is no such thing as
    "all reports" without a caller: §6.3 scopes it to own/in-scope/all by role. An anonymous list
    would have to mean "every report in the city", which is a different endpoint nobody specified.

    ⚠️ **No role check in `permission_classes`.** `IsAuthenticated` establishes *who*; the
    Citizen-only submit rule is `author.role != Role.CITIZEN` inside `create_report()` and the list's
    three-way visibility rule is in `list_reports()` (FR-3). A DRF permission class here would read
    as the enforcement point and drift from it — the reasoning `ProvisionAuthorityView` records.

    ⚠️ **`POST` is rate limited (T2.9, FR-33) and `GET` is not.** FR-33 is about submission; a read
    that costs one indexed query is not the abuse surface, and throttling it would break the map and
    the Authority queue for a legitimately busy operator. `get_throttles()` below is where that split
    is made, because `throttle_classes` alone applies to every method on the view.
