Reporting — persistence (T2.1).

Report intake, validation, media association, submission idempotency, "me-too"/confirm,
comments. T2.1 builds the `Report` entity itself; media association lands with T2.4/T2.6,
idempotency with T2.3, confirmations with T4.7.

⚠️ **A Report is one submission; an Issue is a cluster of Reports** (PRD §6.1, CLAUDE.md). They
are not synonyms. **Severity, status, and assignment live on the Issue** — the only status here
is the Report's own *processing* lifecycle, and the Report never carries resolution status
(data-model §2 "Lifecycle").
