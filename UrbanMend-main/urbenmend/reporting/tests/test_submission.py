"""
T2.2 — `POST /reports`: the fast write, and the enqueue that must outlive it.

T2.1 tested the *rules* (`create_report`). This suite tests the two things T2.2 adds, plus the HTTP
contract over the top of them:

1. **The status moves to `processing`,** meaning "a classification job exists" — the one claim only
   this layer can make.
2. **The enqueue is deferred to commit.** This is the whole task. `transaction.on_commit` is not a
   style choice: an inline `.delay()` publishes a message the instant it runs, and a worker can pick
   it up before the transaction commits — then `Report.objects.get(pk=...)` raises `DoesNotExist` and
   the report is never triaged. It is a race, so it fails *intermittently*, under load, in
   production, and never on a developer's machine. The pair of tests around
   `captureOnCommitCallbacks` is what makes the difference observable.

⚠️ **`task_always_eager` is deliberately NOT configured for tests**, and that is load-bearing here.
Eager mode runs the task body synchronously inside the caller's transaction — which means a suite
running eager would pass with the broken inline `.delay()`, because the "worker" would share the
transaction that has not committed and see the row anyway. It converts the exact bug this task
exists to prevent into a green test. `.delay` is patched instead: the assertion is about *when* the
message is published, which is the property that matters.
