"""`GET /reports/{id}` — the public read (T2.7, API §6.3).

Two rules carry this module. The read is **public** (Q7 resolved), so it must work with no session
at all; and moderation is a **state change** rather than a row delete, which is the only reason
`410 GONE` is expressible for a hidden report instead of a `404` that would look like a bug to the
citizen who filed it.

⚠️ **The body asserted here is the whole point of the task.** §6.3's Report resource nests
`location`, `classification` and `media[]`, and every one of those three is a place where a
plausible implementation is silently wrong: transposed coordinates, a `""` severity band that reads
as a fifth value, or a moderated photo still listed. Each has a test below rather than an assertion
folded into the happy path.
