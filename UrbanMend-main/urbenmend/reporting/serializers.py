"""
Reporting — request/response shapes for `/reports` (T2.2 submit, T2.7 read, T2.8 edit).

⚠️ **The serializer validates *shape*; `services.py` enforces the *rules*** (FR-3, Arch §3.1).
BR-2/BR-3/BR-35 and the Citizen-only check all live in `submit_report()`, so a management command
or a future bulk importer gets them too. What is duplicated here is deliberate defence in depth:
a missing `location` is a field-level `400` with `details[].field == "location"` (API §4.1), which
is a better answer than the service's generic message — and the service still refuses `None`.

⚠️ **`ReportDetailSerializer` renders the same resource for the detail read, the list items and the
`PATCH` response.** §6.3 describes one Report shape; three serializers over one shape would be three
things free to drift, and the client-visible symptom is a field that appears on one endpoint and not
another with nothing in either to explain it.

    §6.3 as amended says an `Idempotency-Key` replay "returns this same `202` body verbatim", and a

    produced. Rendering a `Report` on the fresh path and a stored dict on the replay path would put
    the two bodies in two different pieces of code, free to drift — the client-visible symptom being
    a retry that looks like a *different* submission. One dataclass through one serializer makes them

    `Idempotency-Replayed` header (§4.6), and the bodies must stay byte-identical or the header
    would be redundant and the "verbatim" guarantee false. A test asserts the exact key set.

    so absence has to be distinguishable from a value — and `description: ""` is a *real* value a
    client may send, because BR-3 accepts a report carried by its photo alone. `update_report()`
    reads `None` as "not sent", which only works because an explicit `null` cannot get past here.

    ⚠️ **`category: null` is refused rather than treated as "clear it".** Clearing a category is not
    an edit: it is a request to re-run triage, which this endpoint does not do and which would leave
    `classification_source` naming a human who no longer has a decision attached. A client that wants
    a different category sends one.

    ⚠️ **No `severity` field, and `reject_unknown_fields()` is why sending one fails loudly.** FR-11
    says authorities may "re-severity", but severity lives on the **Issue**, never on the Report
    (CLAUDE.md, data-model "Ownership & Permissions"), so that override is §6.5's endpoint. DRF's
