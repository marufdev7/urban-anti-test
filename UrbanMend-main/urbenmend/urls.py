Root URLconf (A4, T0.3; routes added in A8, T0.6).

URI versioning lives here — `api/v1/` is applied once at this level so no individual route
repeats it [doc: API §5].

⚠️ Do not add endpoints here ahead of the spec. Every route must trace to
`docs/04-api-specification.md`, which is authoritative over the implementation.
