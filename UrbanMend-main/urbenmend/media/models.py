Media — persistence (T2.4).

Upload handling, server-side compression, thumbnailing, EXIF stripping, storage keys.

⚠️ **A Media row is created *unattached*, and that is the contract, not an oversight.** API §6.4
uploads a photo and hands back a handle; §6.3 then submits a report carrying `mediaIds`. So between
those two calls a Media exists with no Report, which is why `report` is nullable and why `owner` is
a column of its own — during that window `owner` is the only thing authorization can key on.

⚠️ **Nothing EXIF-bearing is ever written to storage** (P3, BR-4, ❓Q6 RESOLVED 2026-08-08: strip
all EXIF always). The sanitizing re-encode happens in `services.upload_media()`, in the request,
before the first save — see the reasoning there for why that step is not deferred to the worker
even though the *derivative* work is.

    already EXIF-free in `UPLOADED` — stripping is synchronous (see the module docstring). What
    `PROCESSING` is waiting on is the downscale and the thumbnail. Reading `READY` as "now it is
    safe to serve" would invert that and imply the earlier states are not.

    on a transient storage error would take its Report's BR-3 justification with it — a report that
    was valid at submission would retroactively have no photo and no adequate description.

    ⚠️ **`REMOVED` is how moderation deletes** (FR-31, database.md "No hard deletes"). The read
