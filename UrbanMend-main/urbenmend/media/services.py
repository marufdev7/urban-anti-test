"""
Media — write operations (T2.4/T2.6).

Every state change and every authorization check for photos lives here (FR-3, Arch §3.1). Views
stay thin; `reporting/services.py` calls in here rather than touching `Media` rows itself.

Rules for this file [doc: Arch §3.1, FR-3]:
  - Callers pass the acting user; functions authorize before mutating. DRF permission
    classes are defence-in-depth, never the enforcement point.
  - Wrap multi-write operations in `transaction.atomic`.
  - Enqueue Celery tasks via `transaction.on_commit` so a worker cannot observe an
    uncommitted row [doc: Arch §2.4, §4.1].
  - Reads belong in selectors.py.

⚠️ **The EXIF strip is synchronous; only the derivatives are deferred.** §6.4 describes the pipeline
as asynchronous and answers `202`, while `docs/08-coding-workflow.md` §C3 says "Never store the
original EXIF-bearing file". Both hold at once only if the sanitizing re-encode happens *before* the
first save — which is what `upload_media()` does. Writing the raw upload and stripping in the worker
would put a GPS-tagged photo of a citizen's home in object storage for as long as the queue is deep,
and every retry, dead-letter or worker outage extends that window (P3, BR-4, NFR-12).

The step is cheap and already paid for: deciding between `415` and `422` requires decoding the
image, so by the time the policy check finishes the pixel buffer is already in memory. What stays in
the worker is the genuinely expensive part — LANCZOS downscaling and thumbnail generation (T2.5).
