"""
Media — read operations (T2.4).

Query functions for this module. Kept separate from services.py so reads never acquire write-path
side effects, and so the modules that consume this one have a single documented surface to call
[doc: Arch §3.1].

Rules for this file:
  - No writes, no `transaction.atomic`, no task enqueue.
  - Apply the caller's visibility rules here — a selector that returns rows the actor may
    not see is an authorization bug even though it wrote nothing [doc: Arch §3.1, FR-3].
  - Return querysets or domain objects, never DRF serializers or HTTP responses.

[doc: Arch §3 (FR-7, P3); API §6.4]

    ⚠️ **No actor parameter, and that is the contract rather than an omission.** §6.4 makes media
    visibility "as owning report's visibility", and Q7 resolved report visibility as public. Adding
    an actor here would imply a per-caller rule that does not exist and would drift the moment
    someone assumed it was being applied.

    ⚠️ **`404` for absent, `410` for moderated — the distinction is deliberate and it is a
    disclosure decision, not a nicety.** api-conventions.md reserves `404` for "absent **or hidden
    from this caller**"; `410` is the deliberate admission that something *was* here (FR-31, §6.4).
    Answering `404` for a moderated photo would leave a client retrying forever; answering `410` for
    an id that never existed would confirm to a scanner that the id had once been valid.

    ⚠️ **A `FAILED` or still-`PROCESSING` photo is returned, not hidden.** §6.4's response carries
    `state` precisely so a client can render a placeholder; turning a missing thumbnail into a
    `404` would make an ordinary few-seconds-old upload look deleted.

    `Http404` rather than DRF's `NotFound` so this module stays DRF-free; the handler renders both
    into the same §4.1 envelope.

    FR-31 removed it from.

    queryset there invites an N+1 when the caller is itself in a loop (T2.7's list endpoint). ⚠️ The

    an author blanking its description must be refused. Counting the removed row would let the
    report end up with no evidence at all — which `POST /reports` cannot produce and an edit
    therefore must not either.

    ⚠️ **Shares `_visible_media()` with the two read paths on purpose.** "Visible" is one rule; a
    count that answered a different question from the array `media_for_report()` renders would make
    BR-3 disagree with the payload the client can see.

    in the serializer, in Python, where it is invisible to anyone reading the query. Here the
    exclusion is part of the query the database runs.

    ⚠️ **`to_attr` means `report.media` is left alone**, so a caller that ignores the prefetch gets
    the ordinary unfiltered manager rather than a silently-filtered one. That is the safe direction:
