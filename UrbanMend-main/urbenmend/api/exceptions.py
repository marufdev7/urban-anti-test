Uniform error envelope (A8, T0.6).

Every error response — DRF's own and ours — is rendered as API §4.1:

    {"error": {"code": ..., "message": ..., "details": [...], "traceId": ...}}

DRF's default handler emits `{"detail": ...}` for APIException and a bare field→errors dict for
ValidationError. Two different shapes, neither of them the contract, so `EXCEPTION_HANDLER` is
replaced rather than supplemented [doc: API §4.1, Plan T0.6].

⚠️ `traceId` is read from the contextvar the T0.9 middleware sets, so the id in the response
body is the same one in the log line for that request. Support can go from a screenshot to the
logs with it; a freshly generated id here would break that link silently.
